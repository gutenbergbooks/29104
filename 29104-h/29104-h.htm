<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3><i>The Closed Door Opens</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">In</span> his aimless wanderings around Boston that night
Wilson passed the girl twice, and each time, though
he caught only a glimpse of her lithe form bent against
the whipping rain, the merest sketch of her somber
features, he was distinctly conscious of the impress
of her personality. As she was absorbed by the voracious
horde which shuffled interminably and inexplicably
up and down the street, he felt a sense of loss.
The path before him seemed a bit less bright, the night
a bit more barren. And although in the excitement
of the eager life about him he quickly reacted, he
did not turn a corner but he found himself peering
beneath the lowered umbrellas with a piquant sense of
hope.</p>
<p>Wilson&#8217;s position was an unusual one for a theological
student. He was wandering at large in a strange
city, homeless and penniless, and yet he was not unhappy
in this vagabondage. Every prowler in the dark
is, consciously or unconsciously, a mystic. He is in
touch with the unknown; he is a member of a universal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
cabal. The unexpected, the impossible lurk at every
corner. He brushes shoulders with strange things,
though often he feels only the lightest breath of their
passing, and hears only a rustle like that of an overturned
leaf. But he knows, either with a little shudder
and a startled glance about or with quickened pulse
and eager waiting.</p>
<p>This he felt, and something, too, of that fellowship
which exists between those who have no doors to close
behind them. For such stand shoulder to shoulder
facing the barrier Law, which bars them from the food
and warmth behind the doors. To those in a house
the Law is scarcely more than an abstraction; to those
without it is a tyrannical reality. The Law will not
even allow a man outside to walk up and down in the
gray mist enjoying his own dreams without looking
upon him with suspicion. The Law is a shatterer of
dreams. The Law is as eager as a gossip to misinterpret;
and this puts one, however innocent, in an
aggressive mood.</p>
<p>Looking up at the sodden sky from beneath a dripping
slouch hat, Wilson was keenly alive to this. Each
rubber-coated officer he passed affected him like an insolent
intrusion. He brought home all the mediocrity
of the night, all the shrilling gray, all the hunger, all
the ache. These fellows took the color out of the picture,
leaving only the cold details of a photograph.
They were the men who swung open the street doors
at the close of a matinee, admitting the stale sounds of
the road, the sober light of the late afternoon.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span></div>
<p><a name="P3"></a>
This was distinctly a novel viewpoint for Wilson.
As a student he had most sincerely approved of the
Law; as a citizen of the world behind the closed doors
he had forgotten it. Now with a trace of uneasiness he
found himself resenting it.</p>
<p>A month ago Wilson had thought his life mapped
out beyond the possibility of change, except in its details;
he would finish his course at the school, receive
a church, and pursue with moderate success his task
of holding a parish up to certain ideals. The death
of the uncle who was paying his way, following his
bankruptcy, brought Wilson to a halt from even this
slow pace. At first he had been stunned by this sudden
order of Fate. His house-bleached fellows had gathered
around in the small, whitewashed room where
he had had so many tough struggles with Greek roots
and his Hebrew grammar. They offered him sympathy
and such slight aid as was theirs. Minor scholarships
and certain drudging jobs had been open to him,&ndash;&ndash;the
opportunity to shoulder his way to the goal of
what he had thought his manifest destiny. But that
night after they had gone he locked the door, threw wide
his window, and wandered among the stars. There was
something in the unpathed purple between the spear
points which called to him. He breathed a fresher air
and thrilled to keener dreams. Strange faces came to
him, smiling at him, speaking dumbly to him, stirring
unknown depths within him. He was left breathless,
straining towards them.</p>
<p>The day after the school term closed he had packed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
his extension valise, bade good-bye to his pitying classmates,
and taken the train to Boston. He had only an
indefinite object in his mind: he had once met a friend
of his uncle&#8217;s who was in the publishing business; and
he determined to seek him on the chance of securing
through him work of some sort. He learned that the
man had sold out and moved to the West. Then followed
a week of hopeless search for work until his
small hoard had dwindled away to nothing. To-day
he found himself without a cent.</p>
<p>He had answered the last advertisement just as the
thousand windows sprang to renewed life. It was a
position as shipping clerk in a large department store.
After waiting an hour to see the manager, a double-chinned
ghoul with the eyes of a pig, he had been dismissed
with a glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;For what?&#8221; growled the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;For closing this door,&#8221; answered Wilson, with a
smile.</p>
<p>The fellow shifted the cigar stub which he gripped
with yellow teeth between loose lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you wouldn&#8217;t understand&ndash;&ndash;not in a thousand
years. Good-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The store was dry and warm. He had wandered
about it gazing at the pretty colored garments, entranced
by the life and movement about him, until the
big iron gates were closed. Then he went out upon the
thoroughfare, glad to brush shoulders with the home-goers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
glad to feel one with them in the brilliant pageant
of the living. And always he searched for the face he
had met twice that day.</p>
<p>The lights glowed mellow in the mist and struck out
shimmering golden bars on the asphalt. The song of
shuffling feet and the accompaniment of the clattering
hansoms rang excitedly in his ears. He felt that he
was touching the points of a thousand quick romances.
The flash of a smile, a quick step, were enough to make
him press on eagerly in the possibility that it was here,
perhaps, the loose end of his own life was to be taken up.</p>
<p>As the crowd thinned away and he became more conspicuous
to the prowling eyes which seemed to challenge
him, he took a path across the Public Gardens,
and so reached the broader sweep of the avenue where
the comfortable stone houses snuggle shoulder to
shoulder. The lower windows were lighted behind
drawn shades. Against the stubborn stone angles the
light shone out with appealing warmth. Every window
was like an invitation. Occasionally a door
opened, emitting a path of yellow light to the dripping
walk, framing for a second a man or a woman; sometimes
a man and a woman. When they vanished the
dark always seemed to settle down upon him more
stubbornly.</p>
<p>Then as the clock boomed ten he saw her again.
Through the mist he saw her making her uncertain
way along the walk across the street, stopping every
now and then to glance hesitatingly at the lighted windows,
pause, and move on again. Suddenly, from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
shadow of the area way, Wilson saw an officer swoop
down upon her like a hawk. The woman started back
with a little cry as the officer placed his hand upon her
arm. Wilson saw this through the mist like a shadow
picture and then he crossed the road. As he approached
them both looked up, the girl wistfully, the officer with
an air of bravado. Wilson faced the vigorous form
in the helmet and rubber overcoat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; growled the officer, &#8220;what you doin&#8217; round
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I doing anything wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s wot I&#8217;m goneter find out. Yer&#8217;ve both
been loafin&#8217; here fer an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Wilson, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been loafing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wot yer doin&#8217; then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Living.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson caught an eager look from the shadowed face
of the girl. He met the other eyes which peered
viciously into his with frank aggressiveness. He never
in his life had felt toward any fellow-creature as he
felt towards this man. He could have reached for his
throat. He drew his coat collar more closely about
his neck and unbuttoned the lower buttons to give his
legs freer play. The officer moved back a little, still
retaining his grip on the girl&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;yer better get outern here now,
or I&#8217;ll run you in, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Wilson, &#8220;you&#8217;ll not run in either
of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t, eh? Move on lively&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You go to the devil,&#8221; said Wilson, with quiet
deliberation.</p>
<p>He saw the night stick swing for him, and, throwing
his full weight against the officer, he lifted his arm and
swung up under the chin. Then he seized the girl&#8217;s
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Run,&#8221; he gasped, &#8220;run for all you&#8217;re worth!&#8221;</p>
<p>They ran side by side and darted down the first turn.
They heard the sharp oath, the command, and then the
heavy beat of the steps behind them. Wilson kept the
girl slightly ahead of him, pushing and steadying her,
although he soon found that she was quite as fleet as he
himself was. She ran easily, from the hips, like one
who has been much out of doors.</p>
<p>Their breath came in gasps, but they still heard the
heavy steps behind them and pushed on. As they
turned another corner to the left they caught the sharp
bark of a pistol and saw the spat of a bullet on the
walk to the right of them. But this street was much
darker, and so, while there was the added danger from
stumbling, they felt safer.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s getting winded,&#8221; shouted Wilson to her.
&#8220;Keep on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon they came to a blank wall, but to the left they
discovered an alley. A whiff of salt air beat against
their faces, and Wilson knew they were in the market
road which led along the water front in the rear of the
stone houses. He had come here from the park on hot
days. There were but few lights, and these could not
carry ten yards through the mist. Pressing on, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
kept at her back until she began to totter, and then he
paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;A little further,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll go on tiptoe.&#8221;</p>
<p>They stole on, pressing close to the wall which
bounded the small back yards, making no more noise
than shadows. Finally the girl fell back against
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you go on!&#8221; she begged.</p>
<p>Wilson drew her to his side and pressed back against
one of the wooden doors, holding his breath to listen.
He could barely make out the sodden steps and&ndash;&ndash;they
were receding.</p>
<p>The mist beat in damply upon their faces, but they
could not feel it in the joy of their new-found freedom.
Before them all was black, the road indistinguishable
save just below the pale lights which were scarcely more
than pin pricks in black velvet. But the barrier behind
seemed to thrust them out aggressively.</p>
<p>Struggling to regain his breath, Wilson found his
blood running freer and his senses more alert than for
years. The night surrounding him had suddenly become
his friend. It became pregnant with new meaning,&ndash;&ndash;levelling
walls, obliterating beaten man paths,
cancelling rusty duties. In the dark nothing existed
save souls, and souls were equal. And the world was
an uncharted sea.</p>
<p>Then in the distance he detected the piercing light
from a dark lantern moving in a circle, searching every
nook and cranny. He knew what that meant; this road
was like a blind alley, with no outlet. They had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
trapped. He glanced at the girl huddling at his feet
and then straightened himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;They sha&#8217;n&#8217;t!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;They sha&#8217;n&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>He ran his hand along the door to the latch. It was
locked; but he drew back a few steps and threw his
full weight against it and felt it give a trifle.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll hear us,&#8221; warned the girl.</p>
<p>Though the impact jarred him till he felt dizzy, he
stumbled forward again; and yet again. The lock
gave and, thrusting the girl in, he swung the door to
behind them.</p>
<p>They found themselves in a small, paved yard.
Fumbling about this, Wilson discovered in the corner
several pieces of joist, and these he propped against
the door. Then he sank to the ground exhausted.</p>
<p>In spite of his bruised body, his tired legs, and aching
head, he felt a flush of joy; he was no longer at bay.
A stout barrier stood between him and his pursuers.
And when he felt a warm, damp hand seeking his he
closed over it with a new sense of victory. He was now
not only a fighter, but a protector. He had not yet been
able to see enough of the girl&#8217;s features to form more
than the vaguest conception of what she was. Yet
she was not impersonal; he felt that he could
have found her again in a crowd of ten thousand.
She was a frailer creature who had come to him
for aid.</p>
<p>He gripped her fingers firmly as the muffled sound
of voices came to their ears. The officers had evidently
passed and were now returning, balked in their search.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
Pausing before the little door, they discussed the situation
with the interest of hunters baffled of their
game.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, Murphy, they <i>must</i> have got over this wall
somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Naw, they couldn&#8217;t. There&#8217;s glass atop the
lingth of ut, an&#8217; there isn&#8217;t a door wot isn&#8217;t locked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno. I dunno. This wan here&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He seized the latch and shook the door, kicking it
stoutly with his heavy boots.</p>
<p>Inside, Wilson had risen to his feet, armed with a
short piece of the joist, his lips drawn back so tight as
to reveal his teeth. Wilson had never struck a man in
his life before to-night, but he knew that if that
door gave he should batter until he couldn&#8217;t stand.
He would hit hard&ndash;&ndash;mercilessly. He gripped the
length of wood as though it were a two-handled
scimitar, and waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;D&#8217; ye mind now that it&#8217;s a bit loose?&#8221; said
Murphy.</p>
<p>He put his knee against it and shoved, but the joist
held firm. The man didn&#8217;t know that he was playing
with the certainty of a crushed skull.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, come on!&#8221; broke in the other, impatiently.
&#8220;They&#8217;ll git tired and crawl out. We can wait for
thim at th&#8217; ind. Faith, ut&#8217;s bitter cowld here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man and the girl heard their steps shuffle off,
and even caught the swash of their knees against the
stiff rubber coats, so near they passed. The girl, who
had been staring with strained neck and motionless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
eyes at the tall figure of the waiting man at her side,
drew a long breath and laid her hand upon his knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve gone,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Still he did not move, but stood alert, suspicious,
his long fingers twined around his weapon, fearing with
half-savage passion some new ruse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stand so,&#8221; she pleaded. &#8220;They&#8217;ve gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stick dropped from his hand, and he took off
his hat to let the rain beat upon his hot head.</p>
<p>She crowded closer to his side, shivering with the
cold, and yet more at peace than she had been that
weary, long day. The world, which had stretched to
fearsome distances, shrank again to the compass of this
small yard, and a man stood between her and the gate
to fight off the forces which had surged in upon her.
She was mindful of nothing else. It was enough that
she could stand for even a moment in the shelter of his
strength; relax senses which discovered danger only
to shrink back, powerless to ward it off. A woman
without her man was as helpless as a soldier without
his arms.</p>
<p>The rain soaked through to her skin, and she was
faint with hunger; yet she was content to wait by his
side in silence, in the full confidence that he with his
man strength would stride over the seemingly impossible
and provide. She was stripped to the naked
woman heart of her, forced back to the sheer clinging
instinct. She was simplified to the merely feminine
as he was to the merely masculine. No other laws governed
them but the crude necessity to live&ndash;&ndash;in freedom.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></div>
<p>Before them loomed the dripping wall, beyond that
the road which led to the waiting fists, beyond that the
wind-swept, gray waves; behind them rose the blank
house with its darkened windows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we must go inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>He crossed the yard to one of the ground-floor windows
and tried to raise it. As he expected, it was
locked. He thrust his elbow through a pane just above
the catch and raised it. He climbed in and told her
to wait until he opened the door. It seemed an hour
before he reappeared, framed in the dark entrance.
He held out his hand to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; he bade her.</p>
<p>She obeyed, moving on tiptoe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3><i>Chance Provides</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">For</span> a moment after he had closed the door they
stood side by side, she pressing close to him.
She shivered the length of her slight frame. The hesitancy
which had come to him with the first impress of
the lightless silence about them vanished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said, taking her hand, &#8220;we must find
a light and build a fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>He groped his way back to the window and closed it,
drawing the curtain tight down over it. Then he struck
a match and held it above his head.</p>
<p>At the flash of light the girl dropped his hand and
shrank back in sudden trepidation. So long as he remained
in the shadows he had been to her only a power
without any more definite personality than that of
sex. Now that she was thrown into closer contact with
him, by the mere curtailing of the distances around and
above her, she was conscious of the need of further
knowledge of the man. The very power which had
defended her, unless in the control of a still higher
power, might turn against her. The match flickered
feebly in the damp air, revealing scantily a small room
which looked like a laundry. It was enough, however,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
to disclose a shelf upon which rested a bit of candle.
He lighted this.</p>
<p>She watched him closely, and as the wick sputtered
into life she grasped eagerly at every detail it revealed.
She stood alert as a fencer before an unknown antagonist.
Then he turned and, with this steadier light
above his head, stepped towards her.</p>
<p>She saw eyes of light blue meeting her own of brown
quite fearlessly. His lean face and the shock of sandy
hair above it made an instant appeal to her. She knew
he was a man she could trust within doors as fully as
she had trusted him without. His frame was spare
but suggestive of the long muscles of the New Englander
which do not show but which work on and on
with seemingly indestructible energy. He looked to
her to be strong and tender.</p>
<p>She realized that he in his turn was studying her,
and held up her head and faced him sturdily. In spite
of her drenched condition she did not look so very bedraggled,
thanks to the simple linen suit she had worn.
Her jet black hair, loose and damp, framed an oval
face which lacked color without appearing unhealthy.
The skin was dark&ndash;&ndash;the gypsy dark of one who has
lived much out of doors. Both the nose and the chin
was of fine and rather delicate modeling without losing
anything of vigor. It was a responsive face, hinting of
large emotions rather easily excited but as yet latent,
for the girlishness was still in it.</p>
<p>Wilson found his mouth losing its tenseness as he
looked into those brown eyes; found the strain of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
situation weakening. The room appeared less chill,
the vista beyond the doorway less formidable. Here
was a good comrade for a long road&ndash;&ndash;a girl to meet
life with some spirit as it came along.</p>
<p>She looked up at him with a smile as she heard the
drip of their clothes upon the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to be hung up to dry,&#8221; she laughed.</p>
<p>Lowering the candle, he stepped forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be dry soon,&#8221; he answered confidently.
&#8220;What am I to call you, comrade?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Jo Manning,&#8221; she answered with a bit
of confusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I am David Wilson,&#8221; he said simply. &#8220;Now
that we&#8217;ve been introduced we&#8217;ll hunt for a place to
get dry and warm.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shivered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure the house is empty. It <i>feels</i> empty.
But even if it isn&#8217;t, whoever is here will have to warm
us or&ndash;&ndash;fight!&#8221;</p>
<p>He held out his hand again and she took it as he
led the way along the hall towards the front of the
house. He moved cautiously, creeping along on tiptoe,
the light held high above his head, pausing every
now and then to listen. They reached the stairs leading
to the upper hallway and mounted these. He
pushed open the door, stopping to listen at every rusty
creak, and stepped out upon the heavy carpet. The
light roused shadows which flitted silently about the
corners as in batlike fear. The air smelled heavy,
and even the moist rustling of the girl&#8217;s garments
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
sounded muffled. Wilson glanced at the wall, and
at sight of the draped pictures pressed the girl&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our first bit of luck,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;They <i>have</i>
gone for the summer!&#8221;</p>
<p>They moved less cautiously now, but not until they
reached the dining room and saw the covered chairs
and drawn curtains did they feel fully assured. He
thrust aside the porti&egrave;res and noted that the blinds
were closed and the windows boarded. They could
move quite safely now.</p>
<p>The mere sense of being under cover&ndash;&ndash;of no longer
feeling the beat of the rain upon them&ndash;&ndash;was in itself
a soul-satisfying relief. But there was still the dank
cold of their soggy clothes against the body. They
must have heat; and he moved on to the living rooms
above. He pushed open a door and found himself in
a large room of heavy oak, not draped like the others.
He might have hesitated had it not been for the sight
of a large fireplace directly facing him. When he saw
that it was piled high with wood and coal ready to be
lighted, he would have braved an army to reach it.
Crossing the room, he thrust his candle into the kindling.
The flames, as though surprised at being summoned,
hesitated a second and then leaped hungrily
to their meal. Wilson thrust his cold hands almost
into the fire itself as he crouched over it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come here,&#8221; he called over his shoulder. &#8220;Get
some of this quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>She huddled close to him and together they let
their cold bodies drink in the warm air. It tingled at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
their fingers, smarted into their faces, and stung their
chests.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearer! Nearer!&#8221; he urged her. &#8220;Let it burn
into you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their garments sent out clouds of steam and sweated
pools to the tiles at their feet; but still they bathed in
the heat insatiably. He piled on wood until the flames
crackled out of sight in the chimney and flared into
the room. He took her by the shoulders and turned
her round and round before it as one roasts a goose.
He took her two hands and rubbed them briskly till
they smarted; she laughed deliciously the while, and
the color on her cheeks deepened. But in spite of all
this they couldn&#8217;t get very far below the surface.
He noticed the dripping fringe of her skirts and her
water-logged shoes.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will never do,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to get
dry&ndash;&ndash;clear to your bones. Somehow a woman doesn&#8217;t
look right&ndash;&ndash;wet. She gets so very wet&ndash;&ndash;like a
kitten. I&#8217;m going foraging now. You keep turning
round and round.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Till I&#8217;m brown on the outside?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Till I come back and see if you&#8217;re done.&#8221;</p>
<p>She followed him with her eyes as he went out, and
in less than five minutes she heard him calling for her.
She hurried to the next room and found him bending
over a tumbled heap of fluffy things which he had gingerly
picked from the bureau drawers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Help yourself,&#8221; he commanded, with a wave of
his hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;I oughtn&#8217;t to take these things!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My girl,&#8221; he answered in an even voice that
seemed to steady her, &#8220;when it&#8217;s either these or pneumonia&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s
these. I&#8217;ll leave you the candle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll find something.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went out. She stood bewildered in the midst of
the dimly revealed luxury about her. The candle
threw feeble rays into the dark corners of the big room,
over the four-posted oak bed covered with its daintily
monogrammed spread, over the heavy hangings at the
windows, and the bright pictures on the walls. She
caught a glimpse of closets, of a graceful dressing table,
and finally saw her reflection in the long mirror which
reached to the floor.</p>
<p>She held the candle over her head and stared
at herself. She cut but a sorry figure in her own
eyes in the midst of such spotless richness as now
surrounded her. She shivered a little as her own
damp clothes pressed clammily against her skin.
Then with a flush she turned again to the garments
rifled from their perfumed hiding places. They
looked very white and crisp. She hesitated but a
second.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll forgive,&#8221; she whispered, and threw off her
dripping waist. The clothes, almost without exception,
fitted her remarkably well. She found herself
dressing leisurely, enjoying to the fullest the feel of the
rich goods. She shook her hair free, dried it as best
she could, and took some pains to put it up nicely. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
was long and glossy black, but not inclined to curl. It
coiled about her head in silken strands of dark
richness.</p>
<p>She demurred at first at the silk dress which he had
tossed upon the bed, but she could find no other. It
was of a golden yellow, dainty and foreign in its design.
It fitted snugly to her slim figure as though it
had been made for her. She stood off at a little distance
and studied herself in the mirror. She was a
girl who had an instinct for dress which had never
been satisfied; a girl who could give, as well as take,
an air from her garments. She admired herself quite
as frankly as though it had been some other person
who, with head uptilted and teeth flashing in a contented
smile, challenged her from the clear surface of
the mirror, looking as though she had just stepped
through the wall into the room. The cold, the wet,
and for a moment even the hunger vanished, so that
as she glanced back at her comfortable reflection it
seemed as if it were all just a dream of cold and wet
and hunger. With silk soothing her skin, with the
crisp purity of spotless linen rustling about her, with
the faultless gown falling in rich splendor about her
feet, she felt so much a part of these new surroundings
that it was as though she melted into them&ndash;&ndash;blended
her own personality with the unstinted luxury
about her.</p>
<p>But her foot scuffled against a wet stocking lying as
limp as water grass, which recalled her to herself and
the man who had led the way to this. A wave of pity
swept over her as she wondered if he had found dry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
things for himself. She must hurry back and see that
he was comfortable. She felt a certain pride that the
beaded slippers she had found in the closet fitted her a
bit loosely. With the candle held far out from her in
one hand and the other lifting her dress from the floor,
she rustled along the hall to the study, pausing there
to speak his name.</p>
<p>&#8220;All ready?&#8221; he shouted.</p>
<p>He strode from a door to the left, but stopped in the
middle of the room to study her as she stood framed in
the doorway&ndash;&ndash;a picture for Whistler. With pretty
art and a woman&#8217;s instinctive desire to please, she had
placed the candle on a chair and assumed something
of a pose. The mellow candle-light deepened the raven
black of her hair, softened the tint of her gown until
it appeared of almost transparent fineness. It melted
the folds of the heavy crimson draperies by her side
into one with the dark behind her. She had shyly
dropped her eyes, but in the excitement of the moment
she quickly raised them again. They sparkled with
merriment at sight of his lean frame draped in a
lounging robe of Oriental ornateness. It was of silk
and embellished with gold-spun figures.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was either this,&#8221; he apologized, &#8220;or a dress suit.
If I had seen you first, I should have chosen the latter.
I ought to dress for dinner, I suppose, even if there
isn&#8217;t any.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You look as though you ought to make a dinner
come out of those sleeves, just as the magicians make
rabbits and gold-fish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you,&#8221; he returned, &#8220;look as though you ought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
to be able to get a dinner by merely summoning the
butler.&#8221;</p>
<p>He offered her his arm with exaggerated gallantry
and escorted her to a chair by the fire. She seated herself
and, thrusting out her toes towards the flames, gave
herself up for a moment to the drowsy warmth. He
shoved a large leather chair into place to the left and,
facing her, enjoyed to himself the sensation of playing
host to her hostess in this beautiful house. She looked
up at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you wonder what brought me out there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a general way&ndash;&ndash;yes,&#8221; he answered frankly.
&#8220;But I don&#8217;t wish you to feel under any obligation to
tell me. I see you as you sit there,&ndash;&ndash;that is enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is so little else,&#8221; she replied. She hesitated,
then added, &#8220;That is, that anyone seems to
understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You really had no place to which you could go
for the night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I am an utter stranger here. I came up this
morning from Newburyport&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s about forty miles.
I lost my purse and my ticket, so you see I was quite
helpless. I was afraid to ask anyone for help, and then&ndash;&ndash;I
hoped every minute that I might find my father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I thought you knew no one here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t. If Dad is here, it is quite by chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked again into his blue eyes and then back to
the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is wonderful how you came to me,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw you twice before.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Once,&#8221; she said, &#8220;was just beyond the Gardens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You noticed me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>She leaned forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she repeated, &#8220;I noticed you because of all
the faces I had looked into since morning yours was the
first I felt I could trust.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;I feel as though you
might even understand better than the others what my
errand here to Boston was.&#8221; She paused again, adding,
&#8220;I should hate to have you think me silly.&#8221;</p>
<p>She studied his face eagerly. His eyes showed interest;
his mouth assured her of sympathy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; he bade her.</p>
<p>To him she was like someone he had known before&ndash;&ndash;like
one of those vague women he used to see between
the stars. Within even these last few minutes
he had gotten over the strangeness of her being here.
He did not think of this building as a house, of this
room as part of a home; it was just a cave opening
from the roadside into which they had fled to escape
the rain.</p>
<p>It seemed difficult for her to begin. Now that she
had determined to tell him she was anxious for him to
see clearly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to go back,&#8221; she faltered; &#8220;back a long
way into my life, and I&#8217;m afraid that won&#8217;t be interesting
to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t go very far back,&#8221; he laughed. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
he added seriously, &#8220;I am really interested. Please
to tell it in your own way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, to begin with, Dad was a sea captain and
he married the very best woman in the world. But
she died when I was very young. It was after this
that Dad took me on his long voyages with him,&ndash;&ndash;to
South America, to India, and Africa. I don&#8217;t remember
much about it, except as a series of pictures. I
know I had the best of times for somehow I can remember
better how I felt than what I saw. I used to
play on the deck in the sun and listen to the sailors
who told me strange stories. Then when we reached
a port Dad used to take me by the hand and lead me
through queer, crooked little streets and show me the
shops and buy whole armfuls of things for me. I
remember it all just as you remember brightly colored
pictures of cities&ndash;&ndash;pointed spires in the sunlight,
streets full of bright colors, and dozens of odd men and
women whose faces come at night and are forgotten in
the morning. Dad was big and handsome and very
proud of me. He used to like to show me off and take
me with him everywhere. Those years were very wonderful
and beautiful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then one day he brought me back to shore again,
and for a while we lived together in a large white house
within sight of the ocean. We used to take long walks
and sometimes went to town, but he didn&#8217;t seem very
happy. One day he brought home with him a strange
woman and told me that she was to be housekeeper,
and that I must obey her and grow up to be a fine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
woman. Then he went away. That was fifteen years
ago. Then came the report he was dead; that was ten
years ago. After a while I didn&#8217;t mind so much, for
I used to lie on my back and recall all the places we
had been together. When these pictures began to
fade a little, I learned another way,&ndash;&ndash;a way taught
me by a sailor. I took a round crystal I found in the
parlor and I looked into it hard,&ndash;&ndash;oh, very, very hard.
Then it happened. First all I saw was a blur of colors,
but in a little while these separated and I saw as clearly
as at first all the streets and places I had ever visited,
and sometimes others too. Oh, it was such a comfort!
Was that wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered slowly, &#8220;I can&#8217;t see anything
wrong in that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&ndash;&ndash;the housekeeper&ndash;&ndash;called it wicked&ndash;&ndash;devilish.
She took away the crystal. But after a while
I found I could see with other things&ndash;&ndash;even with just
a glass of clear water. All you have to do is to hold
your eyes very still and stare and stare. Do you
understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>She dropped her voice, evidently struggling with
growing excitement, colored with something of fear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see how close this kept me to Dad?
I&#8217;ve been living with him almost as though I were
really with him. We&#8217;ve taken over again the old
walks and many news ones. This seemed to go on
just the same after we received word that he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
died&ndash;&ndash;stricken with a fever in South America
somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused, taking a quick breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;All that is not so strange,&#8221; she ran on; &#8220;but yesterday&ndash;&ndash;yesterday
in the crystal I saw him&ndash;&ndash;here
in Boston.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As clearly as I see you. He was walking down a
street near the Gardens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It might have been someone who resembled him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it was Dad. He was thinner and looked
strange, but I knew him as though it were only yesterday
that he had gone away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if he is dead&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t dead,&#8221; she answered with conviction.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the strength of that vision you came here to
look for him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you believe, you believe hard, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe the crystal,&#8221; she answered soberly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet you didn&#8217;t find your father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are still sure he is here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am still sure he is living. I may have made a
mistake in the place, but I know he is alive and
well somewhere. I shall look again in the crystal
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, to-morrow,&#8221; answered Wilson, vaguely.</p>
<p>He rose to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there is still the hunger of to-day.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></div>
<p>She seemed disappointed in the lightness with which
apparently he took her search.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t believe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you. And I believe that you believe.
But I have seen little of such things myself. In the
meanwhile it would be good to eat&ndash;&ndash;if only a few
crackers. Are you afraid to stay here alone while I
explore a bit?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>He was gone some ten minutes, and when he came
back his loose robe bulged suspiciously in many places.</p>
<p>&#8220;Madame,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;I beg you to observe
me closely. I snap my fingers twice,&ndash;&ndash;so! Then I
motion,&ndash;&ndash;so! Behold!&#8221;</p>
<p>He deftly extricated from one of the large sleeves
a can of soup, and held it triumphantly aloft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once more,&ndash;&ndash;so!&#8221;</p>
<p>He produced a package of crackers; next a can of
coffee, next some sugar. And she, watching him with
face alight, applauded vigorously and with more
genuine emotion than usually greets the acts of a
prestidigitator.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, oh!&#8221; she exclaimed, with her hands clasped
beneath her chin, &#8220;don&#8217;t you dare to make them disappear
again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Madame,&#8221; answered Wilson, with a bow, &#8220;that
shall be your privilege.&#8221;</p>
<p>He hurried below once more, and this time returned
with a chafing-dish, two bowls, and a couple of iron
spoons which he had found in the kitchen. In ten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
minutes the girl had prepared a lunch which to them
was the culmination of their happiness. Warmed,
clothed, and fed, there seemed nothing left for them.</p>
<p>When they had finished and had made everything
tidy in the room, and he had gone to the cellar and replenished
the coal-hod, he told her something of his
own life. For a little while she listened, but soon the
room became blurred to her and she sank farther and
farther among the heavy shadows and the old paintings
on the wall. The rain beat against the muffled windows
drowsily. The fire warmed her brow like some hypnotic
hand. Then his voice ceased and she drew her
feet beneath her and slept in the chair, looking like a
soft Persian kitten.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3><i>A Stranger Arrives</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">It</span> was almost two in the morning when Wilson heard
the sound of wheels in the street without, and conceived
the fear that they had stopped before the house.
He found himself sitting rigidly upright in the room
which had grown chill, staring at the dark doorway.
The fire had burned low and the girl still slept in the
shadows, her cheeks pressed against her hands. He
listened with suspended breath. For a moment there
was no other sound and so he regained his composure,
concluding it had been only an evil dream. Crossing
to the next room, he drew a blanket from the little
bed and wrapped the sleeping girl about with it so
carefully that she did not awake. Then he gently
poked up the fire and put on more coal, taking each
lump in his fingers so as to make no noise.</p>
<p>Her face, even while she slept, seemed to lose but
little of its animation. The long lashes swept her
flushed cheeks. The eyes, though closed, still remained
expressive. A smile fluttered about her mouth as
though her dreams were very pleasant. To Wilson,
who neither had a sister nor as a boy or man had been
much among women, the sight of this sleeping girl so
near to him was particularly impressive. Her utter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
trust and confidence in his protection stirred within
him another side of the man who had stood by the gate
clutching his club like a savage. She looked so warm
and tender a thing that he felt his heart growing big
with a certain feeling of paternity. He knew at that
moment how the father must have felt when, with the
warm little hand within his own, he had strode down
those foreign streets conscious that every right-hearted
man would turn to look at the pretty girl; with what
joy he had stopped at strange bazaars to watch her eyes
brighten as the shopkeepers did their best to please.
Those must have been days which the father, if alive,
was glad to remember.</p>
<p>A muffled beat as upon the steps without again
brought him to attention, but again the silence closed
in upon it until he doubted whether he had truly heard.
But the dark had become alive now, and he seemed to
see strange, moving shadows in the corners and hear
creakings and rustlings all about him. He turned
sharply at a soft tread behind him only to start at the
snapping of a coal in the fire from the other side.
Finally, in order to ease his mind, he crossed the room
and looked beyond the curtains into the darkness of
the hall. There was neither movement nor sound. He
ventured out and peered down the staircase into the
dark chasm marking the lower hall. He heard distinctly
the sound of a key being fitted rather clumsily
into the lock, then an inrush of air as the door was
thrown open and someone entered, clutching at the wall
as though unable to stand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></div>
<p>It never occurred to Wilson to do the natural and
obviously simple thing: awake the girl at once and
steal down the stairs in the rear until he at least should
have a chance to reconnoitre. It seemed necessary for
him to meet the situation face to face, to stand his
ground as though this were an intrusion upon his own
domain. The girl in the next room was sleeping
soundly in perfect faith that he would meet every
danger that should approach her. And so, by the
Lord, he would. Neither she nor he were thieves or
cowards, and he refused to allow her to be placed for
a minute in such a position.</p>
<p>Someone followed close behind the first man who had
entered and lighted a match. As the light flashed,
Wilson caught a glimpse of two men; one tall and
angular, the other short and broad-shouldered.</p>
<p>&#8220;The&ndash;&ndash;the lights aren&#8217;t on, cabby,&#8221; said one of
them; &#8220;but I&ndash;&ndash;I can find my way all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The divil ye can, beggin&#8217; yer pardon,&#8221; answered
the other. &#8220;I&#8217;ll jist go ahead of ye now an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, cabby, I don&#8217;t need help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jist to th&#8217; top of the shtairs, sor. I know ye&#8217;re
thot weak with sickness&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer came like a military command, though
in a voice heavy with weariness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Light a candle, if you can find one, and&ndash;&ndash;go.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cabby struck another match and applied it to
a bit of candle he found on a hall table. As the light
dissolved the dark, Wilson saw the taller man straighten
before the anxious gaze of the driver.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Sacr&eacute;, are you going?&#8221; exclaimed the stranger,
impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night, sor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night.&#8221; The words were uttered like a
command.</p>
<p>The man went out slowly and reluctantly closed the
door behind him. The echo pounded suddenly in the
distance.</p>
<p>No sooner was the door closed than the man remaining
slumped like an empty grain-sack and only prevented
himself from falling by a wild clutch at the
bannister. He raised himself with an effort, the candle
drooping sidewise in his hand. His broad shoulders
sagged until his chin almost rested upon his breast and
his big slouch hat slopped down over his eyes. His
breathing was slow and labored, each breath being delayed
as long as possible as though it were accompanied
by severe pain. It was clear that only the domination
of an extraordinary will enabled the man to keep his
feet at all.</p>
<p>The stranger began a struggle for the mastery of the
stairs that held Wilson spellbound. Each advance
marked a victory worthy of a battlefield. But at each
step he was forced to pause and rally all his forces
before he went on to the next. First he would twine
his long fingers about the rail reaching up as far as he
was able; then he would lift one limp leg and swing
it to the stair above; he would then heave himself
forward almost upon his face and drag the other leg
to a level with the first, rouse himself as from a tendency
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
to faint, and stand there blinking at the next
stair with an agonized plea as for mercy written in
the deep furrows of his face. The drunken candle
sputtered close to his side, flaring against the skin of
his hand and smouldering into his coat, but he neither
felt nor saw anything. Every sense was forced to a
focus on the exertion of the next step.</p>
<p>Wilson had plenty of time to study him. His lean
face was shaven save for an iron-gray moustache which
was cropped in a straight line from one corner of his
mouth to another. His eyes were half hidden beneath
shaggy brows. Across one cheek showed the red welt
of an old sabre wound. There was a military air about
him from his head to his feet; from the rakish angle
to which his hat tumbled, to his square shoulders,
braced far back even when the rest of his body fell limp,
and to his feet which he moved as though avoiding the
swing of a scabbard. A military cape slipped askew
from his shoulders. All these details were indelibly
traced in Wilson&#8217;s mind as he watched this struggle.</p>
<p>The last ten steps marked a strain difficult to watch.
Wilson, at the top, found his brow growing moist in
sheer agony of sympathy, and he found himself lifting
with each forward heave as though his arms were about
the drooping figure. A half dozen times he was upon
the point of springing to his aid, but each time some
instinct bade him wait. A man with such a will as
this was a man to watch even when he was as near dead
as he now appeared to be. So, backing into the shadows,
Wilson watched him as he grasped the post and slouched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
up the last stair, seeming here to gain new strength for
he held his head higher and grasped the candle more
firmly. It was then that Wilson stepped into the
radius of shallow light. But before he had time to
speak, he saw the eyes raised swiftly to his, saw a
quick movement of the hand, and then, as the candle
dropped and was smothered out in the carpet, he was
blinded and deafened by the report of a pistol almost
in his face.</p>
<p>He fell back against the wall. He was unhurt, but
he was for the moment stunned into inactivity by the
unexpectedness of the assault. He stood motionless,
smothering his breathing, alert to spring at the first
sound. And he knew that the other was waiting for
the first indication of his position to shoot again. So
two, three seconds passed, Wilson feeling with the increasing
tension as though an iron band were being
tightened about his head. The house seemed to settle
into deeper and deeper silence as though it were being
enfolded in layer upon layer of felt. The dark about
him quivered. Then he heard her voice,&ndash;&ndash;the startled
cry of an awakened child.</p>
<p>He sprang across the hall and through the curtains
to her side. She was standing facing the door, her
eyes frightened with the sudden awakening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she trembled, &#8220;what is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>He placed his fingers to her lips and drew her to
one side, out of range of the door.</p>
<p>She snuggled closer to him and placed her hand upon
his arm.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not hurt?&#8221; she asked in a whisper.</p>
<p>He shook his head and strained his ears to the hall
without.</p>
<p>He led her to the wall through which the door opened
and, pressing her close against it, took his position in
front of her. Then the silence closed in upon them
once again. A bit of coal kindled in the grate, throwing
out blue and yellow flames with tiny crackling. The
shadows danced upon the wall. The curtains over the
oblong entrance hung limp and motionless and mute.
For aught they showed there might have been a dozen
eyes behind them leering in; the points of a dozen
weapons pricking through; the muzzles of a dozen
revolvers ready to bark death. Each second he expected
them to open&ndash;&ndash;to unmask. The suspense grew nerve-racking.
And behind him the girl kept whispering,
&#8220;What is it? Tell me.&#8221; He felt her hands upon his
shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush! Listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>From beyond the curtains came the sound of a
muffled groan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone&#8217;s hurt,&#8221; whispered the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t move. It&#8217;s only a ruse.&#8221;</p>
<p>They listened once more, and this time the sound
came more distinct; it was the moaning breathing of
a man unconscious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay where you are,&#8221; commanded Wilson. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
see what the matter is.&#8221;</p>
<p>He neared the curtains and called out,</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you in trouble? Do you need help?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></div>
<p>There was no other reply but that spasmodic intake
of breath, the jerky outlet through loose lips.</p>
<p>He crossed the room and lighted the bit of remaining
candle. With this held above his head, he parted
the curtains and peered out. The stranger was sitting
upright against the wall, his head fallen sideways
and the revolver held loosely in his limp fingers.
As Wilson crossed to his side, he heard the girl at
his heels.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s hurt,&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Stooping quickly, Wilson snatched the weapon from
the nerveless fingers. It was quite unnecessary. The
man showed not the slightest trace of consciousness.
His face was ashen gray. Wilson threw back the man&#8217;s
coat and found the under linen to be stained with blood.
He tore aside the shirt and discovered its source&ndash;&ndash;a
narrow slit just over the heart. There was but one
thing to do&ndash;&ndash;get the man into the next room to the
fire and, if possible, staunch the wound. He placed
his hands beneath the stranger&#8217;s shoulders and half
dragged him to the rug before the flames. The girl,
cheeks flushed with excitement, followed as though
fearing to let him out of her sight.</p>
<p>Under the influence of the heat the man seemed to
revive a bit&ndash;&ndash;enough to ask for brandy and direct
Wilson to a recess in the wall which served as a wine
closet. After swallowing a stiff drink, he regained his
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who the devil&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he began. But he was
checked by a twitch in his side. He was evidently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
uncertain whether he was in the hands of enemies or
not. Wilson bent over him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you badly hurt? Do you wish me to send for
a surgeon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go into the next room and bring me the leather
chest you&#8217;ll find there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson obeyed. The man opened it and took out a
vial of catgut, a roll of antiseptic gauze, several rolls
of bandages, and&ndash;&ndash;a small, pearl-handled revolver.
He levelled this at Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he commanded, &#8220;tell me who the Devil
you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson did not flinch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put it down,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;There is time
enough for questions later. Your wound ought to be
attended to. Tell me what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s eyes narrowed, but his hand dropped to
his side. He realized that he was quite helpless and
that to shoot the intruder would serve him but little.
By far the more sensible thing to do was to use him.
Wilson, watching him, ready to spring, saw the question
decided in the prostrate man&#8217;s mind. The latter
spoke sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take one of those surgical needles and put it in
the candle flame.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson obeyed and, as soon as it was sterilized, further
followed his instructions and sewed up the wound
and dressed it. During this process the stranger
showed neither by exclamation nor facial expression
that he felt in the slightest what must have been excruciating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
pain. At the conclusion of the operation
the man sprinkled a few pellets into the palm of his
hand and swallowed them. For a few minutes after
this he remained very quiet.</p>
<p>Wilson glanced up at the girl. She had turned her
back upon the two men and was staring into the flames.
She was not crying, but her two tightly clenched fists
held closely jammed against her cheeks showed that
she was keeping control of herself by an effort. It
seemed to Wilson that it was clearly his duty to get
her out of this at once. But where could he take
her?</p>
<p>The stranger suddenly made an effort to struggle to
his feet. He had grasped his weapon once again and
now held it aggressively pointed at Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221; demanded Wilson,
quietly stepping forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Matter?&#8221; stammered the stranger. &#8220;To come
into your house and&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he pressed his hand
to his side and was forced to put out an arm to Wilson
for support.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you we mean you no harm. We aren&#8217;t
thieves or thugs. We were driven in here by the rain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By a window in the rear. Let us stay here until
morning&ndash;&ndash;it is too late for the girl to go out&ndash;&ndash;and
you&#8217;ll be none the worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson saw the same hard, determined look that he
had noted upon the stairs return to the gray eyes. It
was clear that the man&#8217;s whole nature bade him resent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
this intrusion. It was evident that he regarded the
two with suspicion, although at sight of the girl, who
had turned, this was abated somewhat.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long have you been here?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some three or four hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are&ndash;&ndash;are there any more of you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has&ndash;&ndash;has there been any call for me while you
have been in the house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>He staggered a little and Wilson suggested that he lie
down once more. But he refused and, still retaining
his grip on the revolver, he bade Wilson lead him to the
door of the next room and leave him. He was gone
some fifteen minutes. Once Wilson thought he caught
the clicking as of a safe being opened. The girl, who
had remained in the background all this while, now
crossed to Wilson&#8217;s side as he stood waiting in the
doorway. He glanced up at her. In her light silk
gown she looked almost ethereal and added to the
ghostliness of the scene. She was to him the one thing
which lifted the situation out of the realm of sheer grim
tragedy to piquant adventure from which a hundred
lanes led into the unknown.</p>
<p>She pressed close to his side as though shrinking
from the silence behind her. He reached out
and took her hand. She smiled up at him and together
they turned their eyes once again into the dark
of the room beyond. Save for the intermittent clicking,
there was silence. In this silence they seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
to grow into much closer comradeship, each minute
knitting them together as, ordinarily, only months
could do.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a cessation of the clicking and
quickly following this the sound of a falling body.
Wilson had half expected some such climax. Seizing
a candle from the table before the fire, he rushed in.
The stranger had fallen to the floor and lay unconscious
in front of his safe.</p>
<p>A quick glance about convinced Wilson that the man
had not been assaulted, but had only fainted, probably
from weakness. His pulse was beating feebly and his
face was ashen. Wilson stooped to place his hands
upon his shoulders, when he caught sight of that which
had doubtless led the stranger to undertake the strain
of opening the safe&ndash;&ndash;a black ebony box, from which
protruded through the opened cover the golden head
of a small, quaint image peering out like some fat
spider from its web. In falling the head had
snapped open so that from the interior of the thing a
tiny roll of parchment had slipped out. Wilson, picking
this up, put it in his pocket with scarcely other
thought than that it might get lost if left on the floor.
Then he took the still unconscious man in his arms and
dragged him back to the fire.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3><i>The Golden God Speaks</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">For</span> a while the man on the floor in his weakness
rambled on as in a delirium.</p>
<p style="clear: both; padding-top: 1.5px;">&#8220;Ah, Dios!&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;There&#8217;s a knife in
every hand.&#8221; Then followed an incoherent succession
of phrases, but out of them the two distinguished this,
&#8220;Millions upon millions in jewels and gold.&#8221; Then,
&#8220;But the God is silent. His lips are sealed by the
blood of the twenty.&#8221;</p>
<p>After this the thick tongue stumbled over some word
like &#8220;Guadiva,&#8221; and a little later he seemed in his
troubled dreams to be struggling up a rugged height,
for he complained of the stones which fretted his feet.
Wilson managed to pour a spoonful of brandy down
his throat and to rebandage the wound which had
begun to bleed again. It was clear the man was suffering
from great weakness due to loss of blood, but as
yet his condition was not such as to warrant Wilson
in summoning a surgeon on his own responsibility.
Besides, to do so would be seriously to compromise
himself and the girl. It might be difficult for them
to explain their presence there to an outsider. Should
the man by any chance die, their situation would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
be such that their only safety would lie in flight. To
the law they were already fugitives and consequently
to be suspected of anything from petty larceny to
murder.</p>
<p>To have forced himself to the safe with all the
pain which walking caused him, the wounded man
must have been impelled by some strong and unusual
motive. It couldn&#8217;t be that he had suspected
Wilson and Jo of theft, because, in the first place, he
must have seen at a glance that the safe was undisturbed;
and in the second, that they had not taken
advantage of their opportunity for flight. It must
have been something in connection with this odd-looking
image, then, at which he had been so eager
to look. Wilson returned to the next room. He
picked the idol from the floor. As he did so the
head snapped back into place. He brought it out
into the firelight.</p>
<p>It looked like one of a hundred pictures he had seen
of just such curiosities&ndash;&ndash;like the junk which clutters
the windows of curio dealers. The figure sat cross-legged
with its heavy hands folded in its lap. The
face was flat and coarse, the lips thick, the nose squat
and ugly. Its carved headdress was of an Aztec
pattern. The cheek-bones were high, and the chin
thick and receding. The girl pressed close to his side
as he held the thing in his lap with an odd mixture
of interest and fear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t its eyes odd?&#8221; she exclaimed instantly.</p>
<p>They consisted of two polished stones as clear as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
diamonds, as brightly eager as spiders&#8217; eyes. The
light striking them caused them to shine and glisten
as though alive.</p>
<p>The girl glanced from the image to the man on the
floor who looked now more like a figure recumbent
upon a mausoleum than a living man. It was as though
she was trying to guess the relationship between these
two. She had seen many such carved things as this
upon her foreign journeys with her father. It called
him back strongly to her. She turned again to the
image and, attracted by the glitter in the eyes, took
it into her own lap.</p>
<p>Wilson watched her closely. He had an odd premonition
of danger&ndash;&ndash;a feeling that somehow it would
be better if the girl had not seen the image. He even
put out his hand to take it away from her, but was
arrested by the look of eagerness which had quickened
her face. Her cheeks had taken on color, her breathing
came faster, and her whole frame quivered with excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better give the thing back to me,&#8221; he said at length.
He placed one hand upon it but she resisted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he insisted, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take it back to where I
found it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She raised her head with a nervous toss.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Let it alone. Let me have it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She drew it away from his hand. He stepped to
her side, impelled by something he could not analyze,
and snatched it from her grasp. Her lips quivered as
though she were about to cry. She had never looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
more beautiful to him than she did at that moment.
He felt a wave of tenderness for her sweep over him.
She was such a young-looking girl to be here alone at
the mercy of two men. At this moment she looked so
ridiculously like a little girl deprived of her doll that
he was inclined to give it back to her again with a
laugh. But he paused. She did not seem to be wholly
herself. It was clear enough that the image had produced
some very distinct impression upon her&ndash;&ndash;whether
of a nature akin to her crystal gazing he could
not tell, although he suspected something of the sort.
The wounded man still lay prone upon the rug before
the fire. His muttering had ceased and his breathing
seemed more regular.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; trembled the girl. &#8220;Please to let me
take it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you wish it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&ndash;&ndash;I can&#8217;t tell you, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She closed her lips tightly as though to check herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it is good for you,&#8221; he said tenderly.
&#8220;It seems to cast a sort of spell over you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what it is! I know if I look deep into
those eyes I shall see my father. I feel that he is very
near, somehow. I must look! I must!&#8221;</p>
<p>She took it from his hands once more and he let it
go. He was curious to see how much truth there was
in her impression and he felt that he could take the
idol from her at any time it seemed advisable to do so.
In the face of this new situation both of them lost
interest in the wounded man. He lay as though asleep.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></div>
<p>The girl seated herself Turk fashion upon the rug
before the grate and, holding the golden figure in her
lap, gazed down into the sparkling stones which
served for eyes. The light played upon the dull,
raw gold, throwing flickering shadows over its face.
The thing seemed to absorb the light growing warmer
through it.</p>
<p>Wilson leaned forward to watch her with renewed
interest. The contrast between the tiny, ugly features
of the image and the fresh, palpitating face of the girl
made an odd picture. As she sat so, the lifeless eyes
staring back at her with piercing insistence, it looked
for a moment like a silent contest between the two.
She commanded and the image challenged. A quickening
glow suffused her neck and the color crept to her
cheeks. To Wilson it was as though she radiated
drowsy waves of warmth. With his eyes closed he
would have said that he had come to within a few
inches of her, was looking at the thing almost cheek
to cheek with her. The room grew tense and silent.
Her eyes continued to brighten until it seemed as
though they reflected every dancing flame in the fire
before her. Still the color deepened in her cheeks
until they grew to a rich carmine.</p>
<p>Wilson found himself leaning forward with quickening
breath. She seemed drifting further and further
away from him and he sat fixed as though in some
trance. He noted the rhythmic heave of her bosom
and the full pulsation at the throat. The velvet sheen
of the hair at her temples caught new lights from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
flames before her and held his eyes like the dazzling
spaces between the coals. Her lips moved, but she
spoke no word. Then it was that, seized with a nameless
fear for the girl, Wilson rose half way to his feet.
He was checked by a command from the man upon
the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the love of God, do not rouse her. She sees!
She sees!&#8221;</p>
<p>The stranger struggled to his elbow and then to
his knees, where he remained staring intently at the
girl, with eyes aglow. Then the girl herself spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lake! The lake!&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>Wilson stepped to her side. He placed a hand
firmly upon her shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you all right?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>She lifted eyes as inscrutable as those of the image.
They were slow moving and stared as blankly at him
as at the pictures on the wall. He bent closer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Comrade&ndash;&ndash;comrade&ndash;&ndash;are you all right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her lips moved to faint, incoherent mutterings. She
did not seem to be in pain, and yet in travail of some
sort.</p>
<p>The stranger, pale, his forehead beaded with the
excitement of the moment, had tottered to his feet
He seized Wilson&#8217;s arm almost roughly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let her alone!&#8221; he commanded. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you see?
Dios! the image speaks!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The image? have you gone mad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! No!&#8221; he ran on excitedly. &#8220;Listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s brow was knitted. Her arms and limbs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
moved restlessly. She looked like one upon the point
of crying at being baffled.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a mist, but I can see&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;I can
see&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave a little sob. This was too much for Wilson.
He reached for the image, but he had not taken a step
before he heard the voice of the stranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Touch that and I shoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice was cold and steady. He half turned and
saw that the man had regained his weapon. The hand
that held it was steady, the eyes back of it merciless.
For one moment Wilson considered the advisability of
springing for him. But he regained his senses sufficiently
to realize that he would only fall in his tracks.
Even a wounded man is not to be trifled with when
holding a thirty-two caliber revolver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Step back!&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson obeyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Farther!&#8221;</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></div>
<p>He retreated almost to the door into the next room.
From that moment his eyes never left the hand which
held the weapon. He watched it for the first sign of
unsteadiness, for the first evidence of weakness or
abstraction. He measured the distance between them,
weighed to a nicety every possibility, and bided his
time. He wanted just the merest ghost of a chance of
reaching that lean frame before the steel devil could
spit death. What it all meant he did not know, but
it was clear that this stranger was willing to sacrifice
the girl to further any project of his into which she
had so strangely fallen. It was also clear to him that
it did the girl no good to lose herself in such a trance
as this. The troubled expression of her face, the
piteous cry in her voice, her restlessness convinced him
of this. When she had spoken to him of crystal gazing,
he had thought of it only as a harmless amusement
such as the Ouija board. This seemed different, more
serious, either owing to the surroundings or to some
really baneful influence from this thing of gold. And
the responsibility of it was his; it was he who had
led the girl in here, it was even he who had placed the
image in her hands. At the fret of being forced to
stand there powerless, the moisture gathered on his
brow.</p>
<p>The stranger knelt on one knee by the girl&#8217;s side,
facing the door and Wilson. He placed one hand
upon her brow and spoke to her in an even tone that
seemed to steady her thoughts. Her words became
more distinct.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look deep,&#8221; he commanded. &#8220;Look deep and the
mists will clear. Look deep. Look deep.&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice was the rhythmic monotone used to lull
a patient into a hypnotic trance. The girl responded
quickly. The troubled expression left her face, her
breathing became deeper, and she spoke more distinctly.
Her eyes were still upon those of the image
as though the latter had caught and held them. She
looked more herself, save for the fact that she appeared
to be even farther away in her thoughts than when in
normal sleep.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Let the image speak through you,&#8221; ran on the
stranger. &#8220;Tell me what you see or hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The lake&ndash;&ndash;it is very blue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see mountains about the lake&ndash;&ndash;very high
mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One is very much higher than the others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! Yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The trees reach from the lake halfway up its
sides.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on!&#8221; he cried excitedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;There they stop and the mountain rises to a
point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To the right there is a large crevice.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stranger moistened his lips. He gave a swift
glance at Wilson and then turned his gaze to the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;See, we will take a raft and go upon the lake.
Now look&ndash;&ndash;look hard below the waters.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl appeared troubled at this. Her feet twitched
and she threw back her head as though for more air.
Once more Wilson calculated the distance between
himself and that which stood for death. He found
it still levelled steadily. To jump would be only to
fall halfway, and yet his throat was beginning to
ache with the strain. He felt within him some new-born
instinct impelling him to her side. She stood
somehow for something more than merely a fellow-creature
in danger. He took a quicker interest in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
her&ndash;&ndash;an interest expressing itself now in a sense of
infinite tenderness. He resented the fact that she was
being led away from him into paths he could not
follow&ndash;&ndash;that she was at the beck of this lean, cold-eyed
stranger and his heathenish idol.</p>
<p>&#8220;Below the waters. Look! Look!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! No!&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;The shrine is there. Seek it! Seek it!&#8221;</p>
<p>He forced the words through his teeth in his concentrated
effort to drive them into the girl&#8217;s brain in
the form of a command. But for some reason she
rebelled at doing this. It was as though to go below
the waters even in this condition choked her until
she must gasp for breath. It was evidently some
secret which lay there&ndash;&ndash;the location of some shrine
or hiding place which he most desired to locate through
her while in this psychic state, for he insisted upon this
while she struggled against it. Her head was lifted
now as though, before finally driven to take the plunge,
she sought aid&ndash;&ndash;not from anyone here in the room,
but from someone upon the borders of the lake where,
in her trance, she now stood. And it came. Her face
brightened&ndash;&ndash;her whole body throbbed with renewed
life. She threw out her hand with a cry which
startled both men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father! Father!&#8221;</p>
<p>The wounded man, puzzled, drew back leaving for
a moment the other unguarded. Wilson sprang, and
in three bounds was across the room. He struck up
the arm just as a finger pressed the trigger. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
wounded man fell back in a heap&ndash;&ndash;far too exhausted to
struggle further. Wilson turned to the girl and swept
the image out of her lap to the floor where it lay blinking
at the ceiling. The girl, blind and deaf to this
struggle, remained sitting upright with the happy smile
of recognition still about her mouth. She repeated
over and over again the glad cry of &#8220;Father! Father!&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson stooped and repeated her name, but received
no response. He rubbed her forehead and her listless
hands. Still she sat there scarcely more than a clay
image. Wilson turned upon the stranger with his
fists doubled up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rouse her!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Rouse her, or I&#8217;ll throttle
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man made his feet and staggered to the girl&#8217;s
side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Awake!&#8221; he commanded intensely.</p>
<p>The eyes instantly responded. It was as though
a mist slowly faded from before them, layer after
layer, as fog rises from a lake in the morning. Her
mouth relaxed and expression returned to each feature.
When at length she became aware of her surroundings,
she looked like an awakened child. Pressing her
fingers to her heavy eyes, she glanced wonderingly
about her. She could not understand the tragical
attitude of the two men who studied her so fixedly.
She struggled to her feet and regarded both men with
fear. With her fingers on her chin, she cowered back
from them gazing to right and left as though looking
for someone she had expected.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Father!&#8221; she exclaimed timidly. &#8220;Are you
here, father?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson took her arm gently but firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father is not here, comrade. He has not
been here. You&ndash;&ndash;you drowsed a bit, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>She caught sight of the image on the floor and
instantly understood. She passed her hands over her
eyes in an effort to recall what she had seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember&ndash;&ndash;I remember,&#8221; she faltered. &#8220;I
was in some foreign land&ndash;&ndash;some strange place&ndash;&ndash;and
I saw&ndash;&ndash;I saw my father.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is odd, because it was <i>here</i> that I saw him
yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her lips were dry and she asked Wilson for a glass
of water. A pitcher stood upon the table, which he
had brought up with the other things. When she had
moistened her lips, she sat down again still a bit stupid.
The wounded man spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what you have just seen
through the medium of that image interests me more
than I can tell you. It may be that I can be of
some help to you. My name is Sorez&ndash;&ndash;and I know
well that country which you have just seen. It is
many thousand miles from here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As far as the land of dreams,&#8221; interrupted Wilson.
&#8220;I think the girl has been worried enough by such
nonsense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You spoke of your father,&#8221; continued Sorez, ignoring
the outburst. &#8220;Has he ever visited South America?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Many times. He was a sea captain, but he has
not been home for years now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Dios!&#8221; exclaimed Sorez, &#8220;I understand now
why you saw so clearly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know my father&ndash;&ndash;you have seen him?&#8221;</p>
<p>He waived her question aside impatiently. His
strength was failing him again and he seemed anxious
to say what he had to say before he was unable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; he began, fighting hard to preserve his
consciousness. &#8220;You have a power that will lead you
to much. This image here has spoken through you.
He has a secret worth millions and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But my father,&#8221; pleaded the girl, with a tremor
in her voice. &#8220;Can it help me to him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! Yes! But do not leave me. Be patient.
The priest&ndash;&ndash;the priest is close by. He&ndash;&ndash;he did
this,&#8221; placing his hand over the wound, &#8220;and I fear
he&ndash;&ndash;he may come again.&#8221;</p>
<p>He staggered back a pace and stared in terror about
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not afraid of most things,&#8221; he apologized,
&#8220;but that devil he is everywhere. He might be&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a sound in the hall below. Sorez placed
his hand to his heart again and staggered back with
a piteous appeal to Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;The image! The image!&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;For the
love of God, do not let him get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he sank in a faint to the floor.</p>
<p>Wilson looked at the girl. He saw her stoop for
the revolver. She thrust it in his hand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3><i>In the Dark</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">Wilson</span> made his way into the hall and
peered down the dark stairs. He listened;
all was silent. A dozen perfectly simple accidents
might have caused the sound the three had heard; and
yet, although he had not made up his mind that the
stranger&#8217;s whole story was not the fabric of delirium,
he had an uncomfortable feeling that someone really
was below. Neither seeing nor hearing, he knew by
some sixth sense that another human being stood
within a few yards of him waiting. Who that human
being was, what he wished, what he was willing to
venture was a mystery. Sorez had spoken of the
priest&ndash;&ndash;the man who had stabbed him&ndash;&ndash;but it
seemed scarcely probable that after such an act as
that a man would break into his victim&#8217;s house, where
the chances were that he was guarded, and make a
second attempt. Then he recalled that Sorez was
apparently living alone here and that doubtless this
was known to the mysterious priest. If the golden
image were the object of his attack, truly it must have
some extraordinary value outside its own intrinsic
worth. If of solid gold it could be worth but a few
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
hundred dollars. It must, then, be of value because
of such power as it had exercised over the girl.</p>
<p>There was not so much as a creak on the floor below,
and still his conviction remained that someone stood
there gazing up as he was staring down. If only the
house were lighted! To go back and get the candle
would be to make a target of himself for anyone
determined in his mission, but he must solve this
mystery. The girl expected it of him and he was
ready to sacrifice his life rather than to stand poorly
in her eyes. He paused at this thought. Until it
came to him at that moment, in that form, he had
not realized anything of the sort. He had not realized
that she was any more to him now than she had
ever been&ndash;&ndash;yet she had impelled him to do an unusual
thing from the first. Yes, he had done for her
what he would have done for no other living woman.
He had helped her out of the clutches of the law,
he had been willing to strike down an officer if it had
been necessary, he had broken into a house for her,
and now he was willing to risk his life. The thought
brought him joy. He smiled, standing there in the
dark at the head of the stairs, that he had in life
this new impulse&ndash;&ndash;this new propelling force. Then
he slid his foot forward and stepped down the first
stair.</p>
<p>He still had strongly that sense of being watched,
but there was no movement below to indicate that this
was anything more than a fancy. Not a sound came
from the room he had just left. Evidently the girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
was waiting breathlessly for his return. He must delay
no longer. He moved on, planning to try the front
door and then to examine the window by which he
himself had entered. These were the only two possible
entrances to the house; the other windows were beyond
the reach of anyone without a ladder and were tightly
boarded in addition. He found the front door fast
locked. It had a patent lock so that the chance of
anyone having opened and closed it again was slight.
He breathed more easily.</p>
<p>Groping along the hallway he was vividly reminded
of the time a few hours past when the girl had placed
her hand within his. It seemed to him that he now
felt the warmth of it&ndash;&ndash;thrilled to the velvet softness
of it&ndash;&ndash;more than he had at the time. He was full
of illusions, excited by all the unusual happenings,
and now, as he felt his way along the dark passage,
he could have sworn that her fingers still rested upon
his. It made him restless to get back to her. He
should not have left her behind alone and unprotected.
It was very possible that this swoon of Sorez&#8217; was but
a ruse. He must hurry on about his investigation.
He descended to the lower floor and groped to the
laundry. It was still dark; the earth would not be
lighted for another hour. He neither heard nor saw
anything here. But when he reached the window by
which he himself had entered but which he had closed
behind him, he gave a start&ndash;&ndash;it was wide open. It
told him of another&#8217;s presence in this house as plainly
as if he had seen the person. There was of course one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
chance in a hundred that the intruder had become
frightened and taken to his heels. Wilson turned back
with fresh fear for the girl whom he had been forced
to leave behind unprotected. If it was true, as the
terrified Sorez had feared, that the priest, whoever
this mysterious and unscrupulous person might be, had
returned to the assault, there certainly was good cause
to fear for the safety of the girl. A man so fanatically
inspired as to be willing to commit murder for the
sake of an idol must be half mad. The danger was
that the girl, in the belief which quite evidently now
possessed her&ndash;&ndash;that this golden thing held the key
to her father&#8217;s whereabouts&ndash;&ndash;might attempt to protect
or conceal it. He stumbled up the dark stairs and fell
flat against the door. It was closed. He tried the
knob; the door was locked. For a moment Wilson
could not believe. It was as though in a second he had
found himself thrust utterly out of the house. His
first suspicion flew to Sorez, but he put this from
his mind instantly. There was no acting possible in
that man&#8217;s condition; he was too weak to get down
the stairs. But this was no common thief who had
done this, for a thief, once realizing a household is
awakened, thinks of nothing further but flight. It
must then be no other than the priest returned to the
quest of his idol.</p>
<p>Wilson threw his weight against the door, but this
was no garden gate to give before such blows. At the
end of a half dozen attempts, he paused, bruised and
dizzy. It seemed impossible to force the bolt. Yet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
no sooner had he reached this conclusion than the
necessity became compelling; the bolt <i>must</i> be forced.
At such moments one&#8217;s emotions are so intensified that,
if there be any hidden passion, it is instantly brought
to light. With the impelling need of reaching the
girl&#8217;s side&ndash;&ndash;a frantic need out of proportion to any
normal relationship between them&ndash;&ndash;Wilson realized
partly the instinct which had governed him from the
moment he had first caught sight of her features in
the rain. If at this stage it could not properly be
called love, it was at least an obsessing passion with all
love&#8217;s attributes. As he paused there in blinding fury
at being baffled by this senseless wooden door, he saw
her as he had seen the faces between the stars, looking
down at him tenderly and trustingly. A lump rose to
his throat and his heart grew big within him. There
was nothing now&ndash;&ndash;no motive, no ambition, no influence&ndash;&ndash;which
could ever control him until after this
new great need was satisfied. All this came over him
in a flash&ndash;&ndash;he saw as one sees an entire landscape
by a single stroke of lightning. Then he faced the door
once again.</p>
<p>The simple accident of the muzzle of his revolver
striking against the door knob furnished Wilson the
inspiration for his next attack. He examined the
cylinder and found that four cartridges remained.
These were all. Each one of them was precious and
would be doubly so once he was beyond this barrier.
He thrust the muzzle of the revolver into the lock and
fired. The bullet ripped and tore and splintered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
Again he placed his shoulder to the door and pushed.
It gave a trifle, but still held. He must sacrifice
another cartridge. He shot again and this time, as
he threw his body full against the bolt, it gave. He
fell in atop the d&eacute;bris, but instantly sprang to his
feet and stumbled along the hall to the stairway.
He mounted this three steps at a time. At the door
to the study he was again checked&ndash;&ndash;there was no light
within and no voice to greet him. He called her name;
the ensuing silence was ghastly in its suggestiveness.
He started through the door, but a slight rustling or
creak caused him to dart back, and a knife in the
hand of some unknown assailant missed him by a
margin so slight that his sleeve was ripped from elbow
to wrist.</p>
<p>With cocked revolver Wilson waited for the rush
which he expected to follow immediately. Save that
the curtains before him swayed slightly, there was
nothing to show that he was not the only human being
in the house. Sorez might still be within unconscious,
but what of the girl? He called her name. There
was no reply. He dashed through the curtains&ndash;&ndash;for
the sixteenth of a second felt the sting of a heavy blow
on his scalp, and then fell forward, the world swirling
into a black pit at his feet.</p>
<p>When Wilson came to himself he realized that he
was in some sort of vehicle. The morning light
had come at last&ndash;&ndash;a cold, luminous gray wash
scarcely yet of sufficient intensity to do more than
outline the world. He attempted to rise, but fell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
back weakly. He felt his neck and the collar of the
luxurious bath robe he still wore to be wet. It was
a sticky sort of dampness. He moved his hand up
farther and found his hair to be matted. His fingers
came in contact with raw flesh, causing him to draw
them back quickly. The carriage jounced over the
roadbed as though the horses were moving at a gallop.
For a few moments he was unable to associate himself
with the past at all; it was as though he had come
upon himself in this situation as upon a stranger.
The driver without the closed carriage seemed bent
upon some definite enough errand, turning corners,
galloping up this street and across that. He tried to
make the fellow hear him, but above the rattling noise
this was impossible. There seemed to be nothing to do
but to lie there until the end of the journey, wherever
that might be.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>He lay back and tried to delve into the past. The
first connecting link seemed years ago,&ndash;&ndash;he was
running away from something, her hand within his.
The girl&ndash;&ndash;yes, he remembered now, but still very
indistinctly. But soon with a great influx of joy he
recalled that moment at the door when he had realized
what she meant to him, then the blind pounding at the
door, then the run upstairs and&ndash;&ndash;this.</p>
<p>He struggled to his elbow. He must get back to
her. How had he come here? Where was he being
taken? He was not able to think very clearly and so
found it difficult to devise any plan of action, but the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
necessity drove him on as it had in the face of the
locked door. He must stop the carriage and&ndash;&ndash;but
even as he was exerting himself in a struggle to make
himself heard, the horses slowed down, turned sharply
and trotted up a driveway to the entrance of a large
stone building. Some sort of an attendant came out,
exchanged a few words with the driver, and then, opening
the door, looked in. He reached out his hand and
groped for Wilson&#8217;s pulse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where am I?&#8221; asked Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, old man,&#8221; replied the attendant
in the paternal tone of those in lesser official positions.
&#8220;Able to walk, or shall I get a stretcher?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Walk? Of course I can walk. What I want to
know is&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But already the strong arms were beneath his shoulders
and half lifting him from the seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slowly. Slowly now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson found himself in a corridor strong with the
fumes of ether and carbolic acid.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; he expostulated, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to come
here. I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;where&#8217;s the driver?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He went off as soon as you got out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But where&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on. This is the City Hospital and you&#8217;re
hurt. The quicker you get that scalp of yours sewed
up the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a few steps Wilson walked along submissively,
his brain still confused. The thought of her came once
again, and he struggled free from the detaining arm
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
and turned upon the attendant who was leading him
to the accident room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going back,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;This is some
conspiracy against the girl. I&#8217;ll find out what it is&ndash;&ndash;and
I&#8217;ll&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The sooner you get that scalp fixed,&#8221; interrupted
the attendant, &#8220;the sooner you&#8217;ll find the girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>The details of the next hour were blurred to him.
He remembered the arrival of the brisk young surgeon,
remembered his irritated greeting at sight of him&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Another
drunken row, I suppose&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and the sharp
fight he put up against taking ether. He had but one
thought in mind&ndash;&ndash;he must not lose consciousness, for
he must get back to the girl. So he fought until two
strong men came in and sat one on his chest and one on
his knees. When he came out of this he was nicely
tucked in bed. They told him that probably he must
stay there three or four days&ndash;&ndash;there was danger of the
wound growing septic.</p>
<p>Wilson stared at the pretty nurse a moment and then
asked, &#8220;I beg your pardon&ndash;&ndash;how long did you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three days anyway, and possibly longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not over three hours longer,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>She smiled, but shook her head and moved away.</p>
<p>It was broad daylight now. He felt of his head&ndash;&ndash;it
was done up in turban-like bandages. He looked
around for his clothes; they were put away. The problem
of getting out looked a difficult one. But he must.
He tried again to think back as to what had happened
to him. Who had placed him in the carriage and given
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
orders to the driver? Had it been done to get rid of
him or out of kindness? Had it been done by the
priest or by Sorez? Above all, what in the meanwhile
had become of his comrade?</p>
<p>When the visiting surgeon came in, Wilson told him
quite simply that he must leave at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better stay, boy. A day here now may save you a
month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A day here now might spoil my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A day outside might cost it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t hold you against your will. But
think again; you&#8217;ve received an ugly blow there and
it has left you weak.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must get out of here at once, whatever the cost.&#8221;</p>
<p>The surgeon indifferently signed the order for his
release and moved on. The nurse brought his clothes.
His only outside garment was the long, gold embroidered
lounging robe he had thrown on while his own
clothes were drying. He stared at it helplessly. Then
he put in on. It did not matter&ndash;&ndash;nothing mattered
but getting back to her as soon as possible.</p>
<p>A few minutes later the citizens of Boston turned to
smile at the sight of a young man with pale, drawn face
hurrying through the streets wearing a white linen
turban and an oriental robe. He saw nothing of them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3><i>Blind Man&#8217;s Buff</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">Wilson</span> undoubtedly would have been stopped
by the police within three blocks had it not
been for the seriousness of his lean face and the evident
earnestness with which he was hurrying about his business.
As it was, he gathered a goodly sized crowd of
street gamins who hooted at his heels until he was forced
to take to the side streets. Here for a few squares he
was not annoyed. The thing that was most disturbing
him was the realization that he knew neither the name
of the street nor the number of the house into which he
had so strangely come last night. He knew its general direction&ndash;&ndash;it
lay beyond the Public Gardens and backed
upon the water front, but that was all. With only this
vague description he could not ask for help without exciting
all manner of suspicion. He must depend upon
his instinct. The situation seemed to him like one of
those grotesque predicaments of a dream. Had his
brain been less intently occupied than it was with the
urgency of his mission, he would have suffered acutely.</p>
<p>He could not have had a worse section of the city to
traverse&ndash;&ndash;his course led him through the business
district, where he passed oddly enough as a fantastic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
advertisement for a tea house,&ndash;&ndash;but he kept doggedly
on until he reached Tremont Street. Here he was beset
by a fresh crowd of urchins from the Common who
surrounded him until they formed the nucleus of a
crowd. For the first time, his progress was actually
checked. This roused within him the same dormant,
savage man who had grasped the joist&ndash;&ndash;he turned
upon the group. He didn&#8217;t do much, his eyes had been
upon the ground and he raised them, throwing back his
head quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me through,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>A few, even at that, shifted to one side, but a half
dozen larger boys pressed in more closely, baiting him
on. They had not seen in his eyes what the others saw.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in a hurry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Let me through.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the crowd laughed; some jeered. All of
them waited expectantly. Wilson took a short, quick
breath. His frame stiffened, and then without a word
he hurled himself forward. He must have been half
mad, for as he bored a passage through, striking to the
right and left, he saw nothing, heard nothing, felt
nothing. His teeth together, his mind once again
centered with burning intensity upon the solitary fact
that he must get back to the girl who had sent him out
to protect her. He was at this moment no more the man
who crammed Hebrew verbs in the confines of that
small, whitewashed room at the theological school than
as though born of a different mother. He was more
like that Wilson who in the days of Miles Standish was
thought to be possessed of devils for the fierceness with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
which he fought Indians. It would have taken a half
dozen strong men to stop him, and no one ventured
to do more than strike at him.</p>
<p>Once he was free of them, he started on, hoping to get
across Park Street and into the Common. But the pack
was instantly at his heels again after the manner of
their kind. He glanced about him baffled, realizing that
with the increasing excitement his chances of pulling
clear of them lessened. He dreaded the arrival of the
police&ndash;&ndash;that would mean questioning, and he could
give no satisfactory explanation of his condition. To
tell the truth would be to incriminate himself, compromise
the girl, and bring about no end of a complication.
He turned sharply and made up the hill at a run. He
was a grotesque enough figure with the long robe streaming
at his heels, his head surmounted by the fantastic
turban, and his face roughened with two days&#8217; beard,
but he made something of a pathetic appeal, too. He was
putting up a good fight. It took only half an eye to see
that he was running on his nerve and that in his eagerness
to get clear, there was nothing of cowardice. Even
now there was not one of the rabble who dared come
within fighting distance of him. It was the harrying
they enjoyed&ndash;&ndash;the sight of a man tormented. A
policeman elbowed his way through the crowd and instead
of clubbing back the aggressors, pushed on to the
young man who was tottering near his finish.</p>
<p>Wilson saw him. He gave one last hurried look about
on the chance of finding some loophole of escape from
that which was worse than the crowd. His eyes fell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
upon the face of a young man in an automobile which
was moving slowly up the hill. It took the latter but a
glance to see that Wilson was a gentleman hard pushed.
The appeal in the eyes was enough. He ordered the
machine stopped and threw open the door. As Wilson
reached it, he leaned forward and grasped his shoulders,
dragging him in. Then the driver threw back his lever
and the machine leaped forward like an unleashed dog.
The officer ordered them to stop, but they skimmed on
up the hill and turning to the left found Beacon Street
a straight path before them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Narrow squeak that time, old man,&#8221; smiled the
stranger. &#8220;What the devil was the trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This, I suppose,&#8221; answered Wilson, as soon as he
had caught his breath, lifting a corner of the elaborate
gown. &#8220;And this,&#8221; touching the bandages on his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what in thunder did they chase you for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess they thought I was crazy&ndash;&ndash;or drunk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it wasn&#8217;t fair sport at a hundred to one.
Where shall I land you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson pondered a second. He would only lose
time if he got out and attempted again to find the house
in that rig.</p>
<p>&#8220;If&ndash;&ndash;if I could only get some clothes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your hotel or home? Take you anywhere
you say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t either a home or a hotel,&#8221; answered Wilson,
deliberately. &#8220;And these are all the clothes I
have in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that a dream?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It is the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; exclaimed the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you now how it came about, but it is
the truth that I am without a cent, and that this is
my entire wardrobe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you come from this morning?&#8221; asked
the other, still incredulous.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the hospital.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson hesitated just a second; he knew that in asking
anything further he ran the risk of being mistaken
for a charlatan, but this seemed now his only chance of
getting back to her. They were speeding out through
the Fenway, but the driver had now slowed down to
await further orders. The man would drop him anywhere
he said, but even supposing he brought him back
to the vicinity of the house, he could not possibly escape
observation long enough to locate that little door in the
rear&ndash;&ndash;the only clue he had to identification of the
house. If ever a man&#8217;s exterior gave promise of generous
help, the features of this fellow by his side did.
He was of about his own age, smooth shaven, with a
frank, open face that gave him a clean and wholesome
appearance. He had the lithe frame and red cheeks of
an athlete in training&ndash;&ndash;his eyes clear as night air, his
teeth white as a hound&#8217;s. But it was a trick of the eyes
which decided Wilson&ndash;&ndash;a bright eagerness tinged with
humor and something of dreams, which suggested that
he himself was alert for just such adventures as this
in which Wilson found himself. He glanced up and
found the other studying him curiously as though trying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
to decide for himself just what sort of a fellow he
had rescued.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame you for being suspicious,&#8221; began
Wilson, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve told you only the truth. Furthermore,
I&#8217;ve done nothing any decent fellow wouldn&#8217;t
do. The police have no right to me, although they
might make a lot of trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, old man. You needn&#8217;t feel
obliged to &#8217;fess up to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to tell you that much,&#8221; answered Wilson,
&#8220;because I want to ask something of you; I want you
to give me a suit of clothes and enough money to keep
me alive for a week.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson saw the other&#8217;s brows contract for a second
as though in keen annoyance or disappointment at this
mediocre turn in a promising situation. He added
quickly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not asking this altogether for myself; there&#8217;s
a girl involved&ndash;&ndash;a girl in great danger. If I get back
to her soon, there is still hope that I can be of some use.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other&#8217;s face brightened instantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that you say? A girl in danger?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In serious danger. This&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he pointed at the
linen turban, &#8220;this ought to give you some idea of how
serious; I was on my way to her when I received this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But good Lord, man, why didn&#8217;t you say so before?
Home, Mike, and let her out!&#8221;</p>
<p>The chauffeur leaned forward and once again the
machine vibrated to the call. They skimmed along the
park roads and into the smooth roads of Brookline.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
From here Wilson knew nothing of the direction or the
locality.</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Danbury,&#8221; his rescuer introduced himself,
&#8220;and I&#8217;m glad to be of help to you. We&#8217;re
about the same size and I guess you can get into some
of my clothes. But can&#8217;t I send a wire or something
to the girl that you are coming?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson shook his head. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly where
she is myself. You see I&ndash;&ndash;I found her in the dark
and I lost her in the dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sort of a game of blind man&#8217;s buff,&#8221; broke in Danbury.
&#8220;But how the devil did you get that swipe in
the head?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know any more than you where that came
from.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You look as though you ought to be tucked away in
bed on account of it. You are still groggy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson tried to smile, but, truth to tell, his head was
getting dizzy again and he felt almost faint.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lie back and take it easy until we reach the house.
I&#8217;ll give you a dose of brandy when we get there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The machine slid through a stone gateway and
stopped before a fine, rambling white house set in the
midst of green trees and with a wide sweep of green
lawn behind it. A butler hurried out and at a nod took
hold of one of Wilson&#8217;s arms and helped him up the
steps&ndash;&ndash;though it was clear the old fellow did not like
the appearance of his master&#8217;s guest. Of late, however,
the boy had brought home several of whom he did not
approve. One of them&ndash;&ndash;quite the worst one to his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
mind&ndash;&ndash;was now waiting in the study. The butler
had crossed himself after having escorted him in. If
ever the devil assumed human shape, he would say that
this was no other than his satanic majesty himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;A gentleman to see you, sir, in the study.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The devil you say,&#8221; snapped Danbury.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not say it, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to take this gentleman in there. However,
we will go to the den.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danbury led the way through a series of rooms to a
smaller room which opened upon the green lawn. It
was furnished in mahogany with plenty of large,
leather-bottomed chairs and a huge sofa. The walls
were decorated with designs of yachts and pictures of
dogs. This room evidently was shut off from the main
study by the folding doors which were partly concealed
by a large tapestry. Danbury poured out a stiff drink
of brandy and insisted upon Wilson&#8217;s swallowing it,
which he did after considerable choking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Danbury, &#8220;you lie down while John
is getting some clothes together, and I&#8217;ll just slip into
the next room and see what my queer friend wants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson stretched himself out and gave himself up to
the warm influx of life which came with the stimulation
from the drink. Pound after pound seemed to be
lifting from his weary legs and cloud after cloud from
his dulled brain. He would soon be able to go back
now. He felt a new need for the sight of her, for the
touch of her warm fingers, for the smile of good fellowship
from her dark eyes. In these last few hours he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
felt that he had grown wonderfully in his intimacy with
her and this found expression in his need of her. Lying
there, he felt a craving that bit like thirst or hunger.
It was something new to him thus to yearn for another.
The sentiment dormant within him had always found
its satisfaction in the impersonal in his vague and distant
dreams. Now it was as though all those fancies of
the past had suddenly been gathered together and embodied
in this new-found comrade.</p>
<p>The voices in the next room which had been subdued
now rose to a point where some phrases were audible.
The younger man seemed to be getting excited, for he
kept exclaiming,</p>
<p>&#8220;Good. That&#8217;s bully!&#8221;</p>
<p>Their words were lost once more, but Wilson soon
heard the sentence,</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you&ndash;&ndash;with you to the end. But what
are <i>you</i> going to get out of this?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then for the first time he heard the voice of the
other. There was some quality in it that made him
start. He could not analyze it, but it had a haunting
note as though it went back somewhere in his own
past. It made him&ndash;&ndash;without any intention of overhearing
the burden of the talk&ndash;&ndash;sit up and listen. It
was decidedly the voice of an older man&ndash;&ndash;perhaps a
foreigner. But if this were so, a foreigner who
had lived long in this country, for the accent
consisted of a scarcely perceptible blur. He spoke
very slowly and with a cold deliberation that was unpleasant.
It was so a judge might pronounce sentence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
of death. It was unemotional and forbidding. Yet
there were little catches in it that reminded Wilson of
some other voice which he could not place.</p>
<p>&#8220;My friend,&#8221; came the voice more distinctly, as
though the owner had risen and now faced the closed
doors between the two rooms, &#8220;my friend, the interests
I serve are truly different from yours; you serve sentiment;
I, justice and revenge. Yet we shall each receive
our reward in the same battle.&#8221; He paused a
moment. Then he added,</p>
<p>&#8220;A bit odd, isn&#8217;t it, that such interests as yours and
mine should focus at a point ten thousand miles from
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Odd? It&#8217;s weird! But I&#8217;m getting used to such
things. I picked up a chap this morning whose story I
wouldn&#8217;t have believed a year ago. Now I&#8217;ve learned
that most anything is possible&ndash;&ndash;even you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you and your heathen army, and your good
English, and your golden idol.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I object to your use of the word &#8216;heathen,&#8217;&#8221; the
other replied sharply.</p>
<p>Wilson started from his couch, now genuinely interested.
But the two had apparently been moving out
while this fag-end of the conversation was going on, for
their voices died down until they became but a hum.
He fell back again, and before he had time to ponder
further Danbury hurried in with a suit of clothes over
his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; he cried excitedly, &#8220;try on these. I must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
be off again in a hurry. I didn&#8217;t mean to keep you
waiting so long, but we&#8217;ll make up the time in the
machine.&#8221;</p>
<p>He tossed out a soft felt hat and blue serge suit.
Wilson struggled into the clothes. Save that the trousers
were a bit short, the things fitted well enough. At
any rate, he looked more respectable than in a lounging
robe. The latter he cast aside, and as he did so
something fell from it. It was a roll of parchment.
Wilson had forgotten all about it, and now thrust
it in an inside pocket. He would give it back to
Sorez, for very possibly it was of some value. He
had not thought of it since it had rolled out of the
hollow image.</p>
<p>Danbury led the way out the door as soon as Wilson
had finished dressing. The latter felt in one of the
vest pockets and drew out a ten dollar bill. He stared
from Danbury to the money.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tuck it away, man, tuck it away,&#8221; said Danbury.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t want to hear it. By the way, you&#8217;d
better make a note of the location of this house in case
you need to find me again. Three hundred and forty
Bellevue,&ndash;&ndash;remember it? Here, take my card and
write it down.&#8221;</p>
<p>It took them twenty minutes to reach the foot of
Beacon street, and here Wilson asked him to stop.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to begin my hunt from here. I wish I
could make you understand how more than grateful
I am.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t waste the time. Here&#8217;s wishing you luck
and let me know how you come out, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>He reached forth his hand and Wilson grasped it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, s&#8217;long, old man. Good luck again.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spoke to the chauffeur. In less than a minute
Wilson was alone again on the street where he had
stood the night before.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3><i>The Game Continues</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">It</span> was almost noon, which made it eight hours since
Wilson was carried out of the house. He had had
less than four hours&#8217; sleep and only the slight nourishment
he had received at the hospital since he and
the girl dined at midnight, yet he was now fairly
strong. His head felt sore and bruised, but he was free
of the blinding ache which so weakened him in the
morning. An austere life together with the rugged
constitution he inherited from his Puritan ancestors
was now standing him in good stead. He turned into
the narrow street which ran along the water front in
the rear of the Beacon Street houses and began his
search for the gate which had admitted him to so many
unforeseen complications. <a name="P75"></a>The river which had raged
so turbulently in the dark was now as mild and blue as
the sky above. A few clouds, all that were left of the
threatening skies of the morning, scudded before a
westerly breeze. It was a fair June day&ndash;&ndash;every house
flooded with sunshine until, however humble, it looked
for the moment like a sultan&#8217;s palace. The path before
him was no longer a blind alley leading from
danger into chaos.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></div>
<p>He found that nearly a third of the houses were
closed for the summer, and that of these at least one
half had small doors leading into fenced courtyards
in the rear. There was not a single mark by which he
might identify that one which he had battered down.
He had only forced the lock so that the door when held
closed again would show no sign of having been touched.
The priest, or whoever it was who had entered after
him, must have taken the same precaution, for every
gate was now fast shut. It seemed a hopeless search.
Then he happened to remember that the policeman had
said that there was glass atop this particular wall. He
retraced his steps. The clue was a good one; he discovered
with a bounding heart that one alone of all
the entrances was so protected. He tried the door, and
found to his further relief that it gave readily. He
stepped within and closed the gate behind him. He
saw then that it had been held by the same piece of
joist he himself had used, but had been so hastily and
lightly fixed as merely to hold the door shut. He ran
across the yard and in another minute was through the
window and once again in the lower hall. It was fairly
light there now; he did not feel as though this was
the same house. This was the third time that he had
hurried along this passage on his way to unknown conditions
above, and each time, though within a period
of less than a full day, had marked a crisis in his life.</p>
<p>As he sprang up the stairs it did not occur to him
that he was unarmed and yet running full ahead into
what had proven a danger spot. It would have mattered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
nothing had he realized this. He had not been
long enough in such games to value precaution. To
reach her side as quickly as possible was the only idea
he could grasp now. At the top of the second flight he
called her name. He received no reply.</p>
<p>He crossed the hall and pushed aside the curtains
which before had concealed his unknown assailant.
The blinds were still closed, so that the room was in
semi-darkness. The fire had gone out. There was no
sign of a human being. Wilson shouted her name once
again. The silence closed in upon him oppressively.
He saw the dead hearth, saw the chair in which she had
curled herself up and gone to sleep, saw the rug upon
which Sorez had reclined, saw the very spot where she
had sat with the image in her lap, saw where she had
stood as she had thrust the revolver into his hand and
sent him on his ill-omened errand. But all these things
only emphasized her absence. It was as though he
were looking upon the scene of events of a year past.
She had gone.</p>
<p>He hurried into the next room&ndash;&ndash;the room where
Sorez, fainting, had fumbled at the safe until he opened
it&ndash;&ndash;the room where he had first seen the image
which had really been the source of all his misfortunes.
The safe door was closed, but about the floor lay a
number of loose papers, as though the safe had been
hastily ransacked. The ebony box which had contained
the idol was gone. Some of the papers were
torn, which seemed to show that this had been done
by the owner in preparing for hasty flight rather than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
by a thief, who would merely rummage through them.
Wilson picked up an envelope bearing a foreign postmark.
It was addressed to Dr. Carl Sorez, and bore
the number of the street where this house was located.
The stamp was of the small South American Republic
of Carlina and the postmark &#8220;Bogova.&#8221; Wilson thrust
the empty envelope in his pocket.</p>
<p>Coming out of here, he next began a systematic
examination of every room on that floor. In the boudoir
where he had found clothes for the girl, he discovered
her old garments still hanging where she had
placed them to dry. Her dress was spread across the
back of a chair, her stockings were below them, and
her tiny mud-bespattered shoes on the floor. They
made him start as though he had suddenly come upon
the girl herself. He crossed the room and almost timidly
placed his hands upon the folds of the gown. These
things were so intimate a part of her that it was almost
like touching her hand. It brought up to him
very vividly the picture of her as she stood shivering
with the cold, all dripping wet before the flames. His
throat ached at the recollection. It had never occurred
to him that she might vanish like this unless, as he had
half feared, he might return to find Sorez dead. This
new turn left him more bewildered than ever. He
went into every room of the house from attic to cellar
and returned again to the study with only this fact of
her disappearance to reward him for his efforts of the
last three hours.</p>
<p>Had this early morning intruder abducted them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
both, or had they successfully hidden themselves until
after he left and then, in a panic, fled? Had the
priest, fearing for Wilson&#8217;s life, thrown him into
the carriage rather than have on his hands a possible
murder? Or after the priest had gone did Sorez find
him and take this way to rid himself of an influence
that might destroy his power over the girl? This last
would have been impossible of accomplishment if the
girl herself knew of it. The other theories seemed
improbable. At any rate, there was little use in sitting
here speculating, when the problem still remained of
how to locate the girl.</p>
<p>He made his way back to the safe and examined
some of the torn letters; they were all in Spanish.
A large part of them bore the same postmark, &#8220;Bogova,
Republic of Carlina.&#8221; The sight of the safe again recalled
to him the fact that he still had in his possession
the parchment which had dropped from the interior
of the idol. It was possible that this might contain
some information which would at any rate explain the
value which these two men evidently placed upon it.
He took it out of his pocket and looked at it with
some curiosity. It was very tightly rolled in a
covering of what appeared to be oilskin. He cut the
threads which held it together and found a second
covering sewed with sinew of some sort. This smelled
musty. Cutting this, he found still a third covering
of a finely pounded metal looking like gold-foil. This
removed revealed a roll of parchment some four inches
long and of about an inch in thickness. When unrolled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
Wilson saw that there were two parchments;
one a roughly drawn map, and the other a document
covered with an exceedingly fine script which he could
not in this light make out at all. Without a strong
magnifying glass, not a word was decipherable. He
thrust it back in his pocket with a sense of disappointment,
when he recalled that he could take it to the
Public Library which was not far from there and
secure a reading glass which would make it all clear.
He would complete his investigation in the house and
then go to the reading room where he had spent so
much of his time during the first week he was in
Boston.</p>
<p>He picked up several fragments of the letters scattered
about, in the hope of obtaining at least some
knowledge of Sorez. The fact that the man had
stopped to tear them up seemed to prove that he had
made plans to depart for good, sweeping everything
from the safe and hastily destroying what was not
valuable. Wilson knew a little Spanish and saw that
most of the letters were of recent date and related
to the death of a niece. Others mentioned the unsettled
condition of government affairs in Carlina.
At one time Sorez must have been very close to the
ruling party, for several of the letters were from
a man who evidently stood high in the ministry,
judged by the intimacy which he displayed with
affairs of state. He spoke several times of the Expedition
of the Hills, in which Sorez had apparently
played a part. But the most significant clause
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
which Wilson found in his hasty examination of the
remnants was this reference:</p>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;There is still, I hear, a great bitterness felt among the
Mountain tribes over the disappearance of the idol of their
Sun God. They blame this on the government and more
than half suspect that you were an important factor in its
vanishing. Have a care and keep a sharp lookout. You
know their priest is no ordinary man. They have implicit
faith that he will charm it back to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was dated three months before. Wilson put
the few remaining bits of this letter in his pocket.
Was it possible that this grinning idol which already
had played so important a part in his own life was the
one mentioned here? And the priest of whom Sorez
spoke&ndash;&ndash;could it be he who ruled these tribes in the
Andes? It was possible&ndash;&ndash;Lord, yes, <i>anything</i> was
possible. But none of these things hinted as to where
the girl now was.</p>
<p>He came back into the study and took a look into the
small room to the left. He saw his own clothes there.
He had forgotten all about them. They were wrinkled
and scarcely fit to wear&ndash;&ndash;all but his old slouch hat.
He smiled as he recalled that at school it was thought
he showed undue levity for a theological student in
wearing so weather-beaten and rakish a hat. He was
glad of the opportunity to exchange for it the one he
now wore. He picked it up from the chair where it lay.
Beneath the rim, but protruding so as to be easily seen,
was a note. He snatched it out, knowing it was from
her as truly as though he had heard her voice. It read:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Dear Comrade:</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>I don&#8217;t know what has become of
you, but I know that if you&#8217;re alive you&#8217;ll come back for me.
We are leaving here now. I haven&#8217;t time to tell you more.
Go to the telephone and ring up Belmont 2748.</p>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:2.0em; text-align:right'><span style='margin-right: 3.0em;'>Hastily, your comrade,</span><br />
<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Jo Manning.</span>&#8221;<br /></p>
<p>Wilson caught his breath. With the quick relief he
felt almost light-headed. She was alive&ndash;&ndash;she had
thought of him&ndash;&ndash;she had trusted him! It deepened
the mystery of how he had come to be carried from the
house&ndash;&ndash;of where they succeeded in hiding themselves&ndash;&ndash;but,
Lord, he was thankful for it all now. He would
have undergone double what he had been through for
the reward of this note&ndash;&ndash;for this assurance of her
faith in him. It cemented their friendship as nothing
else could. For him it went deeper. The words,
&#8220;You&#8217;ll come back here for me,&#8221; tingled through his
brain like some sweet song. She was alive&ndash;&ndash;alive
and waiting for him to come back. There is nothing
finer to a man than this knowledge, that some one is
waiting his return. It was an emotion that Wilson in
his somewhat lonely life had never experienced save
in so attenuated a form as not to be noticeable. He
lingered a moment over the thought, and then, crushing
the old hat&ndash;&ndash;now doubly dear&ndash;&ndash;over his bandaged
head, hurried out of this house in which he had
run almost the gamut of human emotions. He went
out by the laundry window, closing it behind him,
across the courtyard, and made the street without being
seen. That was the last time, he thought, that he would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
ever set foot within that building. He didn&#8217;t find a
public telephone until he reached Tremont Street. He
entered the booth with his heart beating up in his
throat. It didn&#8217;t seem possible that when a few minutes
ago he didn&#8217;t know whether she was dead or alive,
that he could now seat himself here and hope to hear
her voice. His hand trembled as he took down the
receiver. It seemed an eternity before he got central;
another before she connected him with Belmont. He
grew irritable with impatience over the length of time
that elapsed before he heard,</p>
<p>&#8220;A dime, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was forced to drop the receiver and go out for
change. Every clerk was busy, but he interrupted one
of them with a peremptory demand for change. The
clerk, taken by surprise, actually obeyed the command
without a word. When Wilson finally succeeded in
getting the number, he heard a man&#8217;s voice, evidently
a servant. The latter did not know of a Miss Manning.
Who did live there? The servant, grown suspicious
and bold, replied,</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind now, but if ye wishes to talk with any
Miss Manning ye can try somewheres else. Good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See here&ndash;&ndash;wait a minute. I tell you the girl is
there, and I must talk to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;m telling ye she isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there a Mr. Sorez there&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the man who is just after comin&#8217;? Wait a
minute now,&#8221; he put in more civilly, &#8220;an&#8217; I&#8217;ll see,
sor.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></div>
<p>Wilson breathed once more. He started at every
fairy clicking and jingle which came over the waiting
line.</p>
<p>&#8220;Waiting?&#8221;</p>
<p>He almost shouted his reply in fear lest he be cut off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! Yes! waiting. Don&#8217;t cut me off.
Don&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice came timidly, doubtingly&ndash;&ndash;with a little
tremor in it, but it was her voice.</p>
<p>He had not known it long, and yet it was as though
he had always known it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jo&ndash;&ndash;comrade&ndash;&ndash;are you safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and you? Oh, David!&#8221; she spoke his name
hesitatingly, &#8220;David, where did you go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was hurt a little. I lost consciousness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurt, David?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not seriously, but that is why I couldn&#8217;t come
back. I was carried to a hospital.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;David!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her voice was tender with sympathy.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&ndash;&ndash;I came back to the study for you.
You were gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were hidden. There is a secret room where
we stayed until daylight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it was&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The priest. Sorez was so weak and frightened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He came for the image?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but he did not get it. Was it he who&ndash;&ndash;who
hurt you, David?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It must have been. It was just as I came into the
study.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he carried you out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he thought the house empty, I guess, and
feared I was hurt worse than I was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you really are not badly hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not badly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how much&ndash;&ndash;in what way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a blow on the head. Please not to think about
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have thought so many horrible things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Sorez did not dare to stay there. He really
is much stronger, and so he came here to a friend&#8217;s.
I did not dare to let him come alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you aren&#8217;t going to stay there. What are
you going to do now?&#8221;</p>
<p>He thought she hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell, David. My head is in such a whirl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to go back home,&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Home? My home is with my father, and nowhere
else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I want to see you, David, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming out there now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! no! not yet, David.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? I must see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; she said, as though with sudden determination,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
&#8220;because first I wish to make up my mind
to something. I must do it by myself, David.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not disturb you in that. I just wish to see
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you would disturb me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a moment&#8217;s pause. Then,</p>
<p>&#8220;David, I may go away a long distance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you now, but I may go at once. This&ndash;&ndash;this
may be the last time I can talk with you for&ndash;&ndash;oh,
for months.&#8221;</p>
<p>He caught his breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that? What has happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have promised not to tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you must, girl. Why&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;this man Sorez
has no right to exact promises from you. He&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand, David. It&ndash;&ndash;it has to do
with my father and with&ndash;&ndash;with what I saw.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In that cursed image?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the image. But it is not cursed, David.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is&ndash;&ndash;it is if it takes you away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; she trembled, &#8220;you see, I can&#8217;t discuss
it with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t see. I think you ought&ndash;&ndash;you must&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Must, David?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;not that. I suppose I haven&#8217;t the right,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
only&ndash;&ndash;well, it sort of takes my breath away, you
see, to think of your going off&ndash;&ndash;out of my life
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s odd that you should mind&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ve been in it
so short a time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been in it for years,&#8221; he ran on impulsively.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve been in it ever since I learned to look between
the stars and found you there.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was silence for a moment, and then he heard
her voice,</p>
<p>&#8220;David.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a feeling that I may come back into it
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never go out of it. I&#8217;ll not let you. I&#8217;ll&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be foolish, David. And now I must go.
But, David&ndash;&ndash;are you listening, David?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to find me. Don&#8217;t try to see me. I&#8217;m
safe, but if I should need you, I&#8217;ll send for you. Will
you come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To the ends of the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not ring me up again. But before I go
away, if I do go away, I&#8217;ll write to you and tell you
where. I will write you in care of the General Delivery,
Boston&ndash;&ndash;will that reach you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is all, David. That <i>must</i> be all now, for I
must go. Good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Jo&ndash;&ndash;comrade!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a minute, I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But he heard the little click of the receiver and
knew that she had gone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3><i>Of Gold and Jewels Long Hidden</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">Reluctantly</span> Wilson placed the receiver
back upon the hook. It was as though he were
allowing her hand to slip out of his&ndash;&ndash;as though he
were closing a door upon her. The phrase, &#8220;Good-bye,&#8221;
still rang in his ears, but grew fainter and fainter,
receding as in a dream. He stared blankly at the
telephone instrument. Some one opened the door,
anxious to use the booth. This roused him. He came
out into the store, and the life around him brought him
to himself once more. But what did this new development
mean? Where was Sorez leading her, and what
inducement was he offering? Her father she had said.
Doubtless the man was holding out to her promises of
locating him. But why? His mind reverted to the
idol. It was that. He wished to use her psychic power
for some purpose connected with this image. And that?
He had a parchment within his pocket which might
explain it all!</p>
<p>This furnished him an objective which for the moment
gave him rest from useless speculation. But even
while walking to the library he felt a new and growing
passion within him: bitterness towards the man who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
was responsible for taking her away from him. That
Sorez&#8217; claim of being able to find the girl&#8217;s father was
merely to cover a selfish object was of course obvious.
He was playing upon her fancy and sympathy. How
the girl must love this father to be lured from home by
the chance phantom in a crystal picture&ndash;&ndash;to be willing
to follow a stranger half around the globe, perhaps,
because of his promise and a dream. Yet, it was
so he knew that her nature must love&ndash;&ndash;it was so he
would have her love. It was this capacity for fanatical
devotion which struck a responsive chord in his own
heart. Her love would not allow her to have her
father dead even though the report came. Her love
admitted no barriers of land or sea. If so she was
inspired by calm, filial love, what would she not do for
love of her mate? If this mysterious stranger had but
died&ndash;&ndash;he clenched his teeth. That was scarcely a
humane or decent thing to wish.</p>
<p>He found a chair in one corner of the reading room
and borrowed the most powerful reading glass used in
the library. It was only by showing his manuscript
that he was able to secure it. Even then they looked
at him a bit askance, and made him conscious once
more that his head was still bandaged. He had forgotten
all about this, and in another minute he had
forgotten all about it once again.</p>
<p>One of the manuscripts which he spread out upon
the desk before him contained but little writing. A
crudely drawn map filled almost the entire space.
A drawing in the upper left-hand corner represented
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
a blazing sun, and in the lower left-hand corner
another gave the points of the compass. This doubtless
served to illustrate the contents of the other manuscript.</p>
<p>The parchment had been rolled so long and so tightly
that it was almost impossible to straighten it out. He
worked carefully for fear of cracking it. It was a matter
requiring some patience, and consumed the best
part of half an hour. He found that the writing had
been preserved wonderfully well although, as he learned
later, many of the words were so misspelled or poorly
written as to be undecipherable. The writing itself
was painfully minute and labored&ndash;&ndash;as though each
letter had been formed with the greatest effort and
considerable uncertainty. It was as though the author
were thoroughly conversant with Latin&ndash;&ndash;for it was
in that tongue&ndash;&ndash;but as a spoken rather than a written
language. It was such Latin as might be written by a
man who knew his Vulgate and prayers by heart, but
who had little other use for the language. In places,
where evidently the author did not know a word, he
had used a symbol as though the common medium of
communication with him were some sign language.</p>
<p>With what sort of an instrument the writing had
been done it was impossible to conceive, for it was as
fine as could be accomplished with the finest steel engraving.
It occurred to Wilson that possibly this had
been done with a view towards making it illegible to
any ordinary eyes which should chance to see it. With
all these difficulties it was as much as Wilson could do
to make anything at all out of the parchment. But he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
found the work absorbing, and as he began to get an
inkling of what he really held in his hands, lost himself
altogether in his task. At the end of three hours, which
had passed like so many minutes, he took a piece of
paper and wrote down the result of his work, leaving
dashes for words which he had been unable to make
out. He had this broken message:</p>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;I, Manco Capac, priest of the Gilded Man leave this for
my brothers, fearing &ndash;&ndash; from strangers with &ndash;&ndash;. When I
heard Quesada was near and learned that he was about to &ndash;&ndash; the
lake I called twenty of the faithful and with great &ndash;&ndash; we &ndash;&ndash; piece
by piece, using &ndash;&ndash; to &ndash;&ndash; the gifts from the bottom.
Many pieces we &ndash;&ndash; but much gold, gifts of plate, and &ndash;&ndash; with &ndash;&ndash; jewels
we reached. In all six hundred and forty-seven
pieces we carried to where they now rest. I will make a
chart so that it may &ndash;&ndash;. But beware for &ndash;&ndash; the foot stumbles &ndash;&ndash; death
to all &ndash;&ndash; except those who &ndash;&ndash;. The Gilded

leaped from &ndash;&ndash; and their bodies I &ndash;&ndash; where they are
protected by &ndash;&ndash;. Never must be taken from this &ndash;&ndash; for &ndash;&ndash; if &ndash;&ndash;. Those

<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>The gold I &ndash;&ndash; in the farther cave where &ndash;&ndash;, but the jewels
are &ndash;&ndash; beneath and &ndash;&ndash;. The place is &ndash;&ndash; upon the map which
I have made. This I have truly written for those who &ndash;&ndash;. The
hand of the Gilded Man will crush any who &ndash;&ndash;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson, his blood running fast, sat back and thought.
It was clear that the struggle over the image was a
struggle for this treasure. Neither man knew of the
existence of this map. The priest fought to preserve
the idol because of its sacredness as guardian of what
to him was doubtless a consecrated offering to the Sun
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
God; Sorez, acquiring it with the tradition that the
image held the secret, thought that with the psychic
gift of the girl he had solved the riddle. This much
seemed a reasonable explanation. But where was this
treasure, and of what did it consist? He turned to the
second parchment. At the end of an hour he had before
him a half page of minute directions for approaching
the treasure from the starting-point of a hut in
the mountains. But where <i>were</i> these mountains?
He had two names which might be good clues. One
was &#8220;Quesada,&#8221; the old Spanish adventurer, of whom
Wilson had a faint recollection. It was possible that
in the history of his day some mention might be made
of this expedition. The other name was &#8220;Guadiva,&#8221;
which appeared on the map as the name of a lake.
Many of the old Spanish names still remained. A
good atlas might mention it.</p>
<p>He investigated the latter hint first. He was rewarded
at once. &#8220;Guadiva&#8221; was a small lake located
in the extinct volcanic cone of Mt. Veneza, beyond the
upper Cordilleras. It was remarkable chiefly for a
tradition which mentions this as one of the hiding
places of a supposed vast treasure thrown away by the
Chibcas that it might escape the hands of Quesada.</p>
<p>Starting with this, Wilson began a more detailed
search through the literature bearing upon these South
American tribes, Spanish conquest, and English treasure
hunting. He was surprised to find a great deal
of information. Almost without exception, however,
this particular treasure which had sent Quesada to his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
grave a pauper, which had lured from quiet England
Raleigh, Drake, and Leigh was thought to be a myth.
The hours passed and Wilson knew nothing of their
passing. It was eight o&#8217;clock before he paused once
more to summarize the result of his reading. In the
light of the key which lay before him, the possibilities
took away his breath. His quick imagination spanned
the gaps in the narrative until he had a picture before
his eyes that savored of the Arabian Nights. It was a
glittering quest&ndash;&ndash;this which had tempted so many
men, for the prize was greater than Cortez had sought
among the Aztecs, or Pizarro in his bloody conquest of
the Incas.</p>
<p>He saw many thousands of the faithful Chibcas,
most powerful of all the tribes upon the Alta plain,
which lies a green level between the heights of the
white summits of the Andes, toiling up the barren lava
sides of Mount Veneza to where, locked in its gray
cone, lies the lake of Guadiva. He saw this lake smiling
back at the blue sky, its waters clear as the mountain
air which ripples across its surface. The lake of
Guadiva! How many bronzed men had whispered
this name and then dropped upon their knees in prayer.
To Quesada it was just a mirror of blue with unsearchable
depths, but he lived to learn how much more it
meant to the lithe bronze men.</p>
<p>For while the great world beyond was fighting
through the rumbling centuries over its Christ, its
Buddha, its Mahomet, a line of other men plodded the
stubborn path to this beloved spot, their shoulders bent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
beneath their presents, and made their prayer and
offered their gifts to the Gilded Man who lived below
the waters. A tenth, more often a half, of all the
richness of the plains of Alta was offered there in
tribute to him who was their god. He had blessed these
people generously, and mighty was their offering.
Upon a single feast day, tradition had it, a hundred
mules with tinkling silver bells followed the high priest,
in scarlet robes, to the tiny cone, their sharp feet clawing
the lava road, their strong backs aching beneath the
precious burden. This was then transferred to rafts
and gay barges by men blindfolded by the priests and
taken to the secret spot which lay above the sunken
shrine. The worshipers knelt in prayer beneath the
uplifted arms of their pious leaders, then raised high
their golden bowls. For a moment they glinted in the
sun, then flashed a mellow path beneath the waves
which leaped to meet them. Jewels, rarer than any
Roman conquerors found, here kissed the sun as they
were tossed high, then mingled with the crystal lake
like falling stars.</p>
<p>Here it was that Quesada, the adventurous Spaniard,
had sought this treasure. He organized a horde of gold-lustful
minions and descended upon the Chibcas.
The latter were not by nature fighters, but they stood
their ground for their god, and fought like demons.
Quesada forcing his way over their bleeding bodies,
killing even the women who had armed themselves with
knives, pressed up the rocky trail to where the tiny
lake lay as peaceful as a sleeping child. With hands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
upon his hips, he gazed into the waters and smiled.
Then he gave his orders and for many weeks the eager
soldiers dug and sweated in the sun under the direction
of the shrewdest engineers of the age in the attempt
to drain the lake. An outlet was finally made and
the lake sunk foot by foot while the trusting folk below
made their prayers and waited. The answer came.
One day when Quesada saw the treasure almost within
his grasp, there was a mighty rumbling, a crash of
falling stone, and behold! an avalanche of granite
raged down, killing many of the soldiers, routing the
rest, and filled in the man-made channel. Quesada
ordered with fierce oath, but not a man would return
to the work. He was forced to retreat, and died in
poverty and shame.</p>
<p>The years rolled on and still the tributes sank beneath
the waves. Now and then some hardy traveler
returned with a tale of the unlimited wealth that was
going to waste. One such, driven over the seas, came
to Raleigh and reported that he had seen, in a single
procession forming to climb the hill, treasure packed
upon mules to the value of one hundred thousand
English pounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were diamonds,&#8221; so ran the chronicle,
&#8220;larger than a man&#8217;s thumb and of a clearness surpassing
anything even among the crown jewels. I saw
also topaz, sapphires, garnets, turquoises, and opals&ndash;&ndash;all
of a beauty greater than any I ever before saw. As
for gold, it seems of no value whatever, so generously
did they heave it into the lake.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></div>
<p>Leigh sought three years and came back empty
handed, but more convinced than ever that the treasure
existed. Many of the Spaniards who swooped down
upon the Chibcas did not return empty handed, although
they failed to find the source of the El Dorado.
They saw many strange customs which proved that
gold in abundance was located somewhere within this
small area. They saw the chiefs of the tribes cover
themselves each morning with resin and then sprinkle
powdered gold over their bodies until they looked as
though in golden armor. This was washed off at sunset,
after the evening prayer to the burning planet
which they believed to be the source of all their wealth.
At their death their graves were lined with jewels.
The Spanish governors who later looted these tombs
recovered enormous amounts; one grave yielding
$18,000, another $20,000 in gold strips, and still another
$65,000 in emeralds, gold chains, arrows, and
other implements of beaten gold.</p>
<p>But the greatest incentive to the search had always
been the detailed account left by Fray Pedro Simon,
who for twenty years lived among these tribes as missionary,
preceding Valverde, known as the Priest of
the Hills.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the great treasure was in the lake,&#8221; he wrote
in his letters.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no stint of gold, jewelry, emeralds,
food, and other things sacrificed here when a native
was in trouble. With prescribed ceremonies, two ropes
were taken and attached to the rafts which were drawn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
to that portion of the lake where the altar was supposed
to be, below the surface. Two zipas, or priests,
would accompany the person wishing to make the sacrifice
on rafts which were composed of bundles of
dried sticks or flotsam, tied one to another, or made
from planks in the form of a punt holding three or
more persons. By this means they would reach the
altar and, using certain words and ceremonies, throw
in their offerings, small or large, according to their
means. In further reference to this lake, it was the
principal and general place of worship for all this part
of the country, and there are those still alive who state
that they witnessed the burial of many caciques who
left orders that their bodies and all their wealth be
thrown in the waters. When it was rumored that the
bearded men (the Spaniards) had entered the country
in search of gold, many of the Indians brought their
hoarded treasures and offered them as sacrifices in the
lake, so that they should not fall into the hands of the
Spaniards. The present cacique of the village of Simijaca
alone threw into the lake forty loads of gold of
one quintal each, carried by forty Indians from the
village, as is proven by their own statements and those
of the nephew of the cacique sent to escort the Indians.&#8221;</p>
<p>Forty quintals, Wilson computed, is &pound;8820, which
would make this single offering worth to-day
$26,460,000!</p>
<p>He looked up from the dry, crisp documents in front
of him and glanced about the room. The tables were
lined with readers; a schoolgirl scowling over her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
notes, pencil to her pouting lips, an old man trying
to keep his eyes open over his magazine, a young student
from Technology, and a possible art student. Beyond
these, there were workingmen and clerks and
middle-aged bachelors. Truly they were an ordinary
looking lot&ndash;&ndash;prosaic enough, even mediocre, some of
them. This was the twentieth century, and they sat
here in this modern library reading, perhaps, tales of
adventure and hidden treasure. Outside, the trolley
cars clanged past. The young man attendant glanced
up from his catalogue, yawned, studied the clock, and
yawned again.</p>
<p>Wilson looked at them all; then back at his parchment.</p>
<p>Yes, it was still there before his eyes, and represented
a treasure of probably half a billion dollars in
gold and precious stones!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3><i>A Stern Chase</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">Wilson</span> came out into the night with a sense
of the world having suddenly grown larger.
He stood on the broad stone steps of the library, breathing
deep of the June air, and tried to get some sort of
a sane perspective. Below him lay Copley Square;
opposite him the spires of Trinity Church stood against
the purple of the sky like lances; to the right the top
of Westminster was gay with its roof garden, while
straight ahead Boylston street stretched a brilliant
avenue to the Common. Wilson liked the world at
night; he liked the rich shadows and the splendor of
the golden lights, and overhead the glittering stars with
the majestic calm between them. He liked the night
sounds, the clear notes of trolley bell and clattering
hoofs unblurred by the undertone of shuffling feet.
Now he seemed to have risen to a higher level where
he saw and heard it all much more distinctly. The
power and, with the power, the freedom which he felt
with this tremendous secret in his possession filled him
with new life. He lost the sense of being limited, of
being confined. A minute ago this city, at least, had
imprisoned him; now his thoughts flew unrestrained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
around half the globe. But more than anything else
it made him stand better in his own eyes before the
girl. He need no longer await the whims of chance to
bring her to him; he could go in search of her. Somehow
he had never thought of her as a girl to be won
by the process of slow toil&ndash;&ndash;by industry; she must
be seized and carried away at a single coup. The
parchment which rustled crisply in his pocket whispered
how.</p>
<p>The chief immediate value of the secret lay to him
in the power it gave him to check Sorez in whatever
influence he might have gained over the girl. As soon
as he could convince Sorez that the girl&#8217;s psychic
powers were of no use to him in locating the treasure,
he would undoubtedly lose interest in her. Strangely
enough, Wilson felt no moral scruples in retaining
the map which he had found so accidentally; to him it
was like treasure-trove. If it rightly belonged to anyone,
it belonged to this fanatical priest and his people.</p>
<p>In some way, then, he must communicate with Jo
before it was too late. He knew that it was impossible
to locate her through the telephone; the numbers were
not all recorded in the book, and Central was not allowed
to divulge the location of any of them. However,
he would try to reach her again over the wire
in the morning. If unsuccessful at this, he must wait
for her letter. In the meanwhile he would have
plenty to do in pursuing further investigation into the
history and topography of the country covered by his
map. Of course, a great difficulty ahead of him was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
lack of funds. But, if worse came to worse, he thought
it might be possible to interest someone in the project.
There were always men readier to finance a venture of
this sort than a surer and less romantic undertaking.
He would feel better, however, to investigate it alone
if possible, even if it cost him a great deal of time and
labor. All those problems, however, were for the
future&ndash;&ndash;its present worth lay in the influence it gave
him with Sorez.</p>
<p>He came down the library steps and started to cross
the square with a view to walking, but he found his legs
weak beneath him. The best thing he could do now,
he thought, was to devote some attention to the recovery
of his strength. He still had the change from his
ten dollars, and with this recollection he felt a fresh
wave of gratitude for the man who had helped him so
opportunely. He must look him up later on. He
boarded a car and, going down town, entered a restaurant
on Newspaper Row. Here he ordered beefsteak,
potatoes, and a cup of coffee. He enjoyed every
mouthful of it and came out refreshed but sleepy. He
went up town to one of the smaller hotels and secured
a room with a bath. After a warm tub, he turned in
and slept without moving until he awoke with the sun
streaming into the room. He felt the old springiness
in his body as he leaped out of bed, and a courage and
joy beyond any he had ever known at thought of Jo
and the treasure. These two new elements in his life
came to him in the morning with all the freshness and
vividness of their original discovery. In the full glare
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
of the morning sun they seemed even more real than
the night before. He drew the parchment from beneath
his pillow, where he had hidden it, and looked
it over once more before dressing. No, it was not a
dream; it was as real a thing as the commonplace furnishings
of the room.</p>
<p>He took a plunge in cold water and hurried through
his dressing in order to reach the post-office as soon
as possible. He could not believe his eyes when he
came downstairs and saw the clock hands pointing at
twelve. He had slept over fourteen hours. Without
waiting for breakfast, he hurried up town and inquired
for his mail. There was nothing. He was
bitterly disappointed for he had felt sure that she
would write him. It did not seem possible that he
could go on waiting patiently without at least one more
talk with her. Though he knew it was against her
wish, he made up his mind to call her up once more.
He went to the nearest telephone and, asking for the
number, received at the end of five minutes the reply:</p>
<p>&#8220;That number doesn&#8217;t answer, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There must be some mistake. I used it yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try again.&#8221;</p>
<p>He waited several minutes. The droning voice
came once more.</p>
<p>&#8220;I get no answer, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ring &#8217;em hard. I know there is someone there.&#8221;</p>
<p>But nothing Central could do roused any reply.
Either the line was out of order or the occupants of
the house refused to answer the call. He left the booth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
with an uneasy feeling that something was wrong with
the girl. He should not have allowed her to leave the
telephone without telling him her address. It was
possible she was held a prisoner&ndash;&ndash;possible that
Sorez, failing to persuade her to go with him in any
other way, might attempt to abduct her. Doubtless
she had told him her story, and he knew that with only
an indifferent housekeeper to look after the girl no
great stir would be made over her disappearance. Like
dozens of others, she would be accounted for as having
gone to the city to work. The more he thought
of it, the more troubled he became. One thing was
certain; under these circumstances he could no longer
remain passive and wait for her letter. The chances
were that she would not be allowed to write.</p>
<p>He had intended to go out and see Danbury that
afternoon, but he made up his mind to take a car and
go to Belmont on the chance of securing, through the
local office, some information which would enable him
to trace the house. If worse came to worse, he might
appeal to the local police for aid.</p>
<p>Before starting, he returned to the hospital and had
his wound examined. It was in good condition and
the surgeon was able this time to use a very much
smaller dressing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will it need any further treatment?&#8221; Wilson
inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to have the dressing changed once more,
but on a pinch even that will not be necessary so
long as the cut keeps clean. If, however, it begins to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
pain you, that means trouble. Don&#8217;t neglect it a day
if that happens. But I don&#8217;t anticipate anything of
the sort. Probably you can have the stitches out in
a week.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a relief to be able to go out upon the street
again without attracting attention. The snapshot judgment
upon every man with a bandaged head is that he
has been in a street fight&ndash;&ndash;probably while intoxicated.
He bought a clean collar and a tie and indulged
in the luxury of a shoe polish and a shave. When he
stepped out upon the street after this he looked more
like himself than he had for six months. Had it not
been for his anxiety over the girl, he would have felt
exultant, buoyant.</p>
<p>The Belmont car took him through green fields and
strips of woods rich leaved and big with sap. The sun
flecked them with gold and a cooling breeze rustled
them musically. After the rain of the night before the
world looked as fresh as though new made. He was
keenly sensitive to it all and yet it mingled strangely
with the haunting foreign landscape of his imagination&ndash;&ndash;a
landscape with a background of the snow-tipped
summits of the Andes, a landscape with larger,
cruder elements. He felt as though he stood poised between
two civilizations. His eyes met the conventional
details of surroundings among which he had
been born and brought up; he was riding on an open
trolley car, surrounded by humdrum fellow-passengers
who pursued the sober routine of their lives as he
had expected, until within a day, to do, passing through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
a country where conditions were settled&ndash;&ndash;graded, as
it were, so that each might lay his track and move
smoothly upon it; and yet his thoughts moved among
towering mountains untouched by law, among people
who knew not the meaning of a straight path, among
heathen gods and secret paths to hidden gold. Yes,
sitting here staring at the stereotyped inscription
upon the wooden seat-back before him, &#8220;Smoking
on the three rear seats only&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;sitting here in the
midst of advertisements for breakfast foods, canned
goods, and teas,&ndash;&ndash;sitting here with the rounded back
of the motorman and the ever moving brass brake
before his eyes, he still felt in his pocket the dry
parchment which had lain perhaps for centuries in
the heart of a squat idol. While riding through the
pretty toy suburbs in the comfort of an open car,
he was still one with Raleigh and his adventurous
crew sailing the open seas; while still a fellow with
these settled citizens of a well-ordered Commonwealth,
he was, too, comrade to the reckless Quesada&ndash;&ndash;lured
by the same quest. And this was not a dream&ndash;&ndash;it
was not a story&ndash;&ndash;it was dead, sober reality. The
world about him now was no vision; he saw, felt,
and smelled it; the other was equally real, he had
shared in a struggle to possess it, he had the testimony
of his eyes to substantiate it, and the logic of his brain
to prove it. If the wound upon his head was real, if
this girl in search of whom he was now bent was real,
if that within his pocket was real&ndash;&ndash;if, in brief, he
were not a lunatic in complete subjection to a delusion&ndash;&ndash;then,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
however extravagant it might appear, all was
real.</p>
<p>The fact which made it substantial, as nothing
else did, was the girl&ndash;&ndash;the girl and all she meant to
him. It must be a very genuine emotion to turn
the world topsy-turvy for him as it had. This afternoon
for instance, it was she who filled the sunbeams
with golden light, who warmed the blue sky
until it seemed of hazy fairy stuff, who sang among the
leaves, who urged him on with a power that placed no
limit on distance or time. Within less than a day she
had so obsessed him as to cause him to focus upon the
passion the entire strength of his being. The fortune of
gold and jewels before him was great, but if necessary
he could sacrifice it without hesitancy to bring her
nearer to him. That was secondary and so was everything
which lay between him and that one great need.</p>
<p>He sought out the telephone exchange at Belmont
at once and was referred to the superintendent. He
found the latter a brisk, unimaginative man&ndash;&ndash;a creature
of rules and regulations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t do it,&#8221; he said gruffly.</p>
<p>Wilson went a little further into details. The girl
was very possibly a prisoner&ndash;&ndash;very possibly in danger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to the police with your story.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That means the newspapers,&#8221; answered Wilson.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish the affair made public. I may be altogether
wrong in my suspicions, but they are of such
a nature that they ought to be investigated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, but the rule cannot be broken.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></div>
<p>Wilson spent fifteen minutes longer with him, but
the man impatiently rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;That number is not listed,&#8221; he said finally, &#8220;and
under no circumstances are we allowed to divulge it.
You will have to go to the police if you want help.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Wilson had no idea of doing that. He still had
one chance left&ndash;&ndash;a ruse which had occurred to him
as he left the office. He went down stairs and to the
nearest telephone, where he rang up Information.</p>
<p>&#8220;Central?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My line&ndash;&ndash;Belmont 2748&ndash;&ndash;is out of order. Can
you send an inspector up at once?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a minute the reply came.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we can send a man right up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing more&ndash;&ndash;from where does the inspector
start? The house is closed, but I&#8217;ll send my man
along to go up with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a wait of a few minutes. Wilson almost
held his breath. Then came the answer:</p>
<p>&#8220;The inspector leaves from the central office. Have
your man ask for Mr. Riley.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In twenty minutes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson went out and walked around the block. He
had told a deliberate lie and was perpetrating a downright
fraud, but he felt no conscientious scruples over
it. It was only after he had exhausted every legitimate
method that he had resorted to this. When he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
came around to the entrance door again he found a
young man standing there with a tool bag in his hand.
He stepped up to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;This Mr. Riley?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was to tell you to go on right out to the house.
The man is there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson started on, but stopped to look into the drugstore
window. The man went down the street to the
car corner. Wilson again circled the block and waited
until he saw Riley board the car on the front platform.
He kept out of sight until the car had almost
passed him and then swung on to the rear. The stratagem
was simplicity itself.</p>
<p>At the end of a ten-minute ride the inspector
swung off and at the next corner Wilson followed. It
was easy enough to keep the man in sight, and apparently
he himself had escaped detection. The inspector
approached a modest looking house setting a
bit back from the road and, going to the front door,
rang the bell. At the end of perhaps three minutes
he rang again. At the end of another five he rang a
third time. The curtains were down in the front windows,
but that was not uncommon in hot June days.
The inspector went to the rear. In a few minutes
he came back. He tried the door once more and then,
apparently bewildered, came out. He hung around
for some ten minutes more, and then, returning to the
corner, took the first car back.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></div>
<p>It seemed clear enough that the occupants of the
house were gone, but Wilson waited a few minutes
longer, unwilling to accept the possibilities this suggested.
He even went up and tried the bell himself.
A servant from the neighboring house called across
to him:</p>
<p>&#8220;They all drove off in a carriage an hour ago, sir,&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many of them?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Davis and his aunt and his friend, the old
man, and the young girl&ndash;&ndash;all of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the servants&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t but one&ndash;&ndash;old man Sullivan,&#8221; she answered
with some scorn.</p>
<p>&#8220;And they went where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord, now how d&#8217; ye suppose I know that?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a second Wilson looked so disconsolate that she
offered her last bit of information.</p>
<p>&#8220;They took their trunks with &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; he replied as he turned on his heels and
ran for the approaching car.</p>
<p>He made it. During the ride in town his mind was
busy with a dozen different conjectures, each wilder
than the preceding one. He was hoping against hope
that she had written him and that her letter now
awaited him in the post-office.</p>
<p>Reaching the Federal Building, he waited breathlessly
at the tiny window while the indifferent clerk
ran over the general mail. With a large bundle of
letters in his hand he skimmed them over and finally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
paused, started on, returned, and tossed out a letter.
Wilson tore it open. It was from Jo. It read:</p>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Dear Comrade:</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>I have made my decision&ndash;&ndash;I am
going with Dr. Sorez to Bogova, South America. I have
just written them at home and now I am writing you as I
promised. I&#8217;m afraid you will think, like the others, that I
am off on a senseless quest; but perhaps you won&#8217;t. If only
you knew how much my father is to me! Dr. Sorez is sure
he is still living. I know he used to go to Carlina, of which
Bogova is the capitol. Why he should let us believe him
dead is, of course, something for me to learn. At any rate, I
am off, and off&ndash;&ndash;to-day. The priest makes it unsafe for
Dr. Sorez to remain here any longer. You see, I have a long
journey before me. But I love it. I&#8217;m half a sailor, you
know.</p>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>I am writing this in the hope that you will receive it in time
to meet me at the steamer&ndash;&ndash;the Columba, a merchantman.
It sails at four from Pier 7, East Boston. If not, let me tell
you again how much I thank you for what you have done&ndash;&ndash;and
would do. From time to time I shall write to you, if you
wish, and you can write to me in care of Dr. Carl Sorez, the
Metropole, Bogova, Carlina. When I come back we must
meet again. Good luck to you, comrade.</p>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:2.0em; text-align:right'><span style='margin-right: 4.0em;'>Sincerely yours,</span><br />
<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Jo Manning.</span>&#8221;<br /></p>
<p>Meet her at the steamer! The boat sailed at four.
It was now quarter of. He ran from the building to
Washington street. Here he found a cab.</p>
<p>&#8220;Five dollars,&#8221; he panted, &#8220;if you get me to Pier 7,
East Boston, at four o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>He jumped in and had hardly closed the door before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
the cabby had brought his whip across the flanks of
the dozing horse. The animal came to life and tore
down Washington Street at a pace that threatened to
wreck the vehicle. The wheels skimmed sides of
electric cars and brushed the noses of passing teams.
A policeman shouted, but the cabby took a chance and
kept on. Down Atlantic Avenue the light cab swayed
from side to side, swerving to within a hair&#8217;s distance
of the elevated structure. They wasted five precious
minutes at the Ferry. From here the distance was
short. At one end of the wharf Wilson sprang through
the small group of stevedores who, their work done,
were watching the receding steamer. He was too late
by five minutes. But he pushed on to the very tip
of the wharf in his endeavor to get as near as possible
to the boat. The deck looked deserted save for
the bustling sailors. Then Fate favored him with
one glance of her. She had come up from below, evidently
for a last look at the wharf. He saw her&ndash;&ndash;saw
her start&ndash;&ndash;saw her hesitate, and then saw her impulsively
throw out her arms to him. He felt a lump
in his throat as, with his whole heart in the action,
he in his turn reached towards her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>Strange Fishing</h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">Yes,</span> her arms were extended towards him. The
fact made the world swim before his eyes.
Then he thought of Sorez and&ndash;&ndash;it was well Sorez
was not within reach of him. Slowly the barrier
widened between Wilson and his Comrade&ndash;&ndash;slowly
she faded from sight, even while his eyes strained to
hold the last glimpse of her. It seemed as though the
big ship were dragging the heart out of him. On it
went, slowly, majestically, inevitably, tugging, straining
until it was difficult for him to catch his breath.
She was taking away not only her own sweet self, but
the joy and life from everything about him; the color
from the sky, the gold from the sunbeams, the savor
from the breezes. To others the sky was blue, the
sun warm, and the salt-laden winds came in from
over the sea with pungent keenness. To others the
waters were sprinkled with joyous colors&ndash;&ndash;the white
sails of yachts, the weather-beaten sails of the
fishermen, and the gaudy funnels of the liners.
But to him it was all gray, gray&ndash;&ndash;a dull, sodden
gray.</p>
<p>He felt a tug at his sleeve and heard the gruff
voice of the cabby.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What about my fare?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your fare?&#8221;</p>
<p>He had forgotten. He reached in his pocket and
drew out a roll of bills, thrusting them into the grimy
hands of the man without looking at them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now get out,&#8221; he ordered.</p>
<p>Wilson watched the fading hulk until it was lost
in the tangle of other shipping. Then he tried to
hold the line of black smoke which it left in its wake.
When that finally blended with the smoke from other
funnels which misted into the under surface of the
blue sky, he turned about and stared wearily at the
jumble of buildings which marked the city that was
left. The few who had come on a like mission dispersed,&ndash;&ndash;sucked
into the city channels to their
destinations as nickel cash boxes in a department
store are flashed to their goals. Wilson found himself
almost alone on the pier. There was but one other
who, like himself, seemed to find no interest left
behind by the steamer. Wilson merely glanced at him,
but soon looked back, his interest excited by something
or other in the man&#8217;s appearance. He was no
ordinary looking man&ndash;&ndash;a certain heavy, brooding
air relieved of moroseness by twinkling black eyes
marked him as a man with a personality. He was
short and thick set, with shaggy, iron-gray eyebrows,
a smooth-shaven face speckled on one side as by a
powder scar. Beneath a thin-lipped mouth a stubborn
chin protruded. He was dressed in a flannel shirt and
corduroy trousers, fastened by a black belt. He had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
the self-sufficient air of the sailor or miner, which is
developed by living a great deal apart from other men.
It seemed to Wilson that the man was watching him,
too, with considerable interest. Every now and then
he removed the short clay pipe which he was smoking
and covered a half circle with his eyes which invariably
included Wilson. Finally he lounged nearer and
a few minutes later asked for a match.</p>
<p>Wilson, who was not much given to forming chance
acquaintanceships, was at first inclined to be suspicious,
and yet it was he who made the next advance,
prompted, however, by his eagerness for information.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know anything about sailing lines to South
America?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>The older man removed his pipe. Wilson thought
he looked a bit startled&ndash;&ndash;a bit suspicious at the
question.</p>
<p>&#8220;What port?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>It occurred to Wilson that it might be just as well
not to divulge his real destination. The only other
South American port he could think of was Rio
Janeiro, on the east coast.</p>
<p>&#8220;How about to Rio?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell of a hole&ndash;&ndash;Rio,&#8221; observed the stranger,
with a sad shake of his head. &#8220;But fer that matter
so&#8217;s everywhere. Never found a place what wasn&#8217;t.
This is,&#8221; he affirmed, sweeping his pipe in a semicircle.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right there,&#8221; agreed Wilson, the blue sky
above clouding before his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heern there&#8217;s goneter be an earthquake here
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
some day. Swaller up the whole darned place. Guess
it&#8217;s so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson studied the man once more; he began to
think the fellow was a trifle light-headed. But he
decided not; he was probably only one of those with
so strong an individuality as to be thought queer.
The stranger was staring out to sea again as though,
in the trend of fresh speculations, he had lost all
interest in the conversation. However, in a minute
he withdrew his pipe from his mouth, and, without
turning his head, asked,</p>
<p>&#8220;Was you reckoning as a passenger or was yer
lookin&#8217; for a chance to ship?&#8221;</p>
<p>That was a proposition Wilson had not considered.
It had no more occurred to him that a man untrained
could secure work on a ship than on a railroad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think it is possible for me to get a job?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;I&#8217;ve not had any experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some things yer don&#8217;t need experience
fer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing to do anything&ndash;&ndash;from peeling potatoes
to scrubbing decks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s better nor that fer a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to find it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stranger studied the younger man from the
corner of his eyes, pressing down the live coals in his
pipe with a calloused forefinger.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you was only goin&#8217; to the West Coast, now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What? Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say pretty far up&ndash;&ndash;Say to Carlina?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></div>
<p>Wilson could scarcely believe his ears. He steadied
himself. This must be more than mere coincidence,
he thought. For all he knew, this man might be some
agent of the priest. Perhaps the latter had some inkling
of what had been found. But if that were so,
there was little doubt but what the priest would have
taken up the search for it himself. At any rate, Wilson
felt well able to care for himself. The parchment was
safe in an inside pocket which he had fastened at the
top with safety pins. The advantage in having it
there was that he could feel it with a slight pressure
of his arm. If an opportunity offered to get to Carlina,
he would accept it at whatever risk. Wilson
answered slowly after the manner of one willing to
consider an offer but eager to make a good bargain.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know but what Carlina would suit me as
well as Rio. It&#8217;s more to get away from here than
anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You has the right spirit, m&#8217; boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused, then added indifferently,</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno but what I can find a berth fer you. Come
if ye wanter, an&#8217; we&#8217;ll talk it over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson followed. This at least offered possibilities.
The stranger lolled the length of the dock shed and
out into the street as unconcernedly as though only
upon a stroll. They turned into the main thoroughfare
among the drays and ship-chandlers&#8217; shops, out
into the busy, unconcerned life of the city. The
stranger was as unconscious of the confusion about
him as though he were the only occupant of the street,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
crossing in front of the heavy teams with a nonchalance
that forced frantic drivers to draw their horses to
their haunches, and motormen to bend double over
their brakes. Oaths and warnings apparently never
reached him. Once Wilson clutched at his broad
shoulders to save him from a motor car. He merely
spat at the rear wheels.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t git killed if I wanted to,&#8221; he grumbled.</p>
<p>They brought up finally before a barroom and
entered, passing through to the small iron tables in
the rear. The dim gas revealed smudged walls ornamented
with dusty English sporting prints&ndash;&ndash;a cock
fight, a fist fight, and a coach and four done in colors.
A dwarf of a waiter swabbed off the wet disks made
by beer glasses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two half and halfs,&#8221; ordered the stranger.</p>
<p>When they were brought, he shoved one towards
Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drink,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Might&#8217;s well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson gulped down the bitter beer. It cleared his
head and gave him new life. The stranger ordered
another.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t talk to a man when he&#8217;s thirsty,&#8221; he observed.</p>
<p>The room grew hazily warm, and Wilson felt himself
glowing with new life and fresh courage.</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Stubbs&ndash;&ndash;Jonathan Stubbs,&#8221; explained
the stranger, as Wilson put down the empty
mug. &#8220;Follered the sea for forty year. Rotten hard
work&ndash;&ndash;rotten bad grub&ndash;&ndash;rotten poor pay. Same on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
land as on sea, I reckon. No good anywhere. Got
a friend who&#8217;s a longshoreman and says th&#8217; same
&#8217;bout his work. No good anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused as though waiting for the other to introduce
<i>himself</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Wilson, haven&#8217;t done much of anything&ndash;&ndash;and
that&#8217;s rotten poor fun. But I want to
get to South America and I&#8217;ll do anything under the
sun that will pay my way there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; laughed Wilson, &#8220;anything, to heaving
coal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Fraid of your neck?&#8221; asked Stubbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Try me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gut any family?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever shipped afore?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stubbs settled further back in his chair and studied
the ceiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wotcher want to git there for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a friend who&#8217;s somewhere down there,&#8221;
he said frankly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Women,&#8221; mused Stubbs, &#8220;is strange. Can&#8217;t never
lay your hand on a woman. Here they are an&#8217; here
they ain&#8217;t. I had a woman once&#8217;t. Yes, I had a
woman once&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>He relapsed into a long silence and Wilson studied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
him with friendlier interest than before. Life was
written large upon his wrinkled face, but the eyes
beneath the heavy brows redeemed many of the bitter
lines. It was clear that the man had lived much
within himself in spite of his long rubbing against
the world. He was a man, Wilson thought, who could
warn men off, or welcome them in, at will.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; he resumed, &#8220;maybe you&#8217;ll come an&#8217;
maybe you won&#8217;t. Come if you wanter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To Choco Bay. Can&#8217;t promise you nothin&#8217; but
a berth to the port,&ndash;&ndash;good pay an&#8217; a damned rough
time after you get there. Maybe your throat cut in
the end.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; said Wilson, instantly.</p>
<p>The gray eyes brightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I ain&#8217;t promised you nothin&#8217;, have I, but to
git you to the coast?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hain&#8217;t said nothin&#8217;, have I, &#8217;bout what may happen
to you after you git there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only that I may get my throat cut.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the difference if you do? But if you
wants to, I&#8217;ll gamble my chest agin a chaw that you
won&#8217;t. Nothin&#8217; ever comes out right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to. I most particularly object
to getting my throat cut.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Stubbs, &#8220;maybe you will. Where&#8217;s
your kit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On my back.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll need more than that. Come on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stubbs led the way to a second-hand store and bought
for his new-found friend a flannel shirt, trousers like
his own, a pair of stout boots, and a cap.</p>
<p>Wilson had nothing left of his ten dollars.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the same,&#8221; said Stubbs. &#8220;Settle when you
git your pay.&#8221;</p>
<p>He led him then to a pawn shop where he picked
out a thirty-two calibre revolver and several boxes of
cartridges. Also a thick-bladed claspknife.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Stubbs,&#8221; objected Wilson, &#8220;I don&#8217;t need
those things. I&#8217;m not going pirating, am I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe so. Maybe only missionaryin&#8217;. But a
gun&#8217;s a useful ornyment in either case.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew out a heavy silver watch and with his forefinger
marking off each hour, computed how much
time was left to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What d&#8217; ye say,&#8221; he broke out, looking up at
Wilson, &#8220;what d&#8217; ye say to goin&#8217; fishin&#8217;, seein&#8217; as
we&#8217;ve gut a couple of hours on our hands?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fishing?&#8221; gasped Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fishin&#8217;,&#8221; answered the other, calmly. &#8220;I know a
feller down by the wharf who&#8217;ll take us cheap.
Might&#8217;s well fish as anything else. Prob&#8217;ly won&#8217;t git
none. Never do. I&#8217;ll jus&#8217; drop in below here and
git some bait an&#8217; things.&#8221;</p>
<p>A dozen blocks or so below, he left Wilson on the
sidewalk and vanished into a store whose windows
were cluttered with ship&#8217;s junk. Anchor-chains, tarpaulin,
marlinspikes, ropes, and odd bits of iron were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
scattered in a confusion of fish nets. Stubbs emerged
with a black leather bag so heavy that he was forced
to ask Wilson to help him lift it to his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to fish with cast-iron worms?&#8221; asked
Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe so. Maybe so.&#8221;</p>
<p>He carried the bag lightly once it was in place and
forged a path straight ahead with the same indifference
to pedestrians he had shown towards teams,
apparently deaf to the angry protestations of those who
unwisely tried their weight against the heavy bag.
Suddenly he turned to the right and clambered down
a flight of stairs to a float where a man was bending
over a large dory.</p>
<p>&#8220;Engaged for to-day?&#8221; he demanded of the young
fellow who was occupied in bailing out the craft. The
man glanced up at Stubbs and then turned his attention
to Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;My friend,&#8221; went on Stubbs, &#8220;I want to get a
little fishin&#8217; &#8217;fore dark. Will you &#8217;commodate me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get in, then,&#8221; growled the owner.</p>
<p>He helped Stubbs lower the bag into the stern, with
the question,</p>
<p>&#8220;Any more to your party?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is all,&#8221; answered Stubbs.</p>
<p>In five minutes Wilson found himself in the prow
being rowed out among the very shipping at which
a few hours before he had stared with such resentment.
What a jackstraw world this had proved itself to him
in this last week! It seemed that on the whole he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
had had very little to do with his own life, that he
was being juggled by some unknown hand. And yet
he seemed, too, to be moving definitely towards some
unknown goal. And this ultimate towards which his
life was trending was inseparably bound up with that
of the girl. His heart gave a bound as they swung out
into the channel. He felt himself to be close on the
heels of Jo. It mattered little what lay in between.
The incidents of life counted for nothing so long as
they helped him to move step by step to her side.
He had come to his own again,&ndash;&ndash;come into the
knowledge of the strength within him, into the swift
current of youth. He realized that it was the privilege
of youth to meet life as it came and force it to
obey the impulses of the heart. He felt as though
the city behind him had laid upon him the oppressive
weight of its hand and that now he had shaken it free.</p>
<p>The color came back once more into the world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3><i>What was Caught</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">The</span> man at the oars rowed steadily and in
silence with an easy swing of his broad
shoulders. He wormed his way in and out of the
shipping filling the harbor with the same instinct with
which a pedestrian works through a crowd. He slid
before ferry boats, gilded under the sterns of schooners,
and missed busy launches by a yard, never pausing in
his stroke, never looking over his shoulder, never speaking.
They proceeded in this way some three miles
until they were out of the harbor proper and opposite
a small, sandy island. Here the oarsman paused and
waited for further orders. Stubbs glanced at his big
silver watch and thought a moment. It was still a
good three hours before dark. Beyond the island a
fair-sized yacht lay at anchor. Stubbs took from his
bag a pair of field glasses and leveled them upon this
ship. Wilson followed his gaze and detected a fluttering
of tiny flags moving zigzag upon the deck. After
watching these a moment Stubbs, with feigned indifference,
turned his glasses to the right and then
swung them in a semicircle about the harbor, and
finally towards the wharf they had left. He then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
carefully replaced the glasses in their case, tucked
them away in the black bag, and, after relighting his
pipe, said,</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use er fishin&#8217;?&#8221; He added gloomily,
&#8220;Never catch nothin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>He glanced at the water, then at the sky, then at
the sandy beach which lay just to port.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go ashore and think it over,&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>The oarsman swung into action again as silently
and evenly as though Stubbs had pressed an electric
button.</p>
<p>In a few minutes the bow scraped upon the sand,
and in another Stubbs had leaped out with his bag.
Wilson clambered after. Then to his amazement, the
latter saw the oarsman calmly shove off and turn the
boat&#8217;s prow back to the wharf. He shot a glance at
Stubbs and saw that the latter had seen the move,
and had said nothing. For the first time he began to
wonder in earnest just what sort of a mission they
were on.</p>
<p>Stubbs stamped his cramped legs, gave a hitch to
his belt, and filled his clay pipe, taking a long time
to scrape out the bowl, whittle off a palmful of tobacco,
roll it, and stuff it into the bowl with a care which
did not spill a speck of it. When it was fairly burning,
he swept the island with his keen eyes and suggested
that they take a walk.</p>
<p>The two made a circle of the barren acres which
made up the island and returned to their starting
point with scarcely a word having been spoken. Stubbs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
picked out a bit of log facing the ship and sat down.
He waved his hand towards the yacht.</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is the craft that&#8217;ll take us there&ndash;&ndash;if
it don&#8217;t go down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t we go aboard, then?&#8221; ventured Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause why? &#8217;Cause we&#8217;re goneter wait fer the
other fishermen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope they have found as comfortable a fishing-ground
as we have.&#8221;</p>
<p>He studied Stubbs a moment and then asked
abruptly,</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the meaning of this fishing story?&#8221;</p>
<p>Stubbs turned upon him with a face as blank as the
cloudless sky above.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I was goneter give a bright young man advice
&#8217;bout this very trip,&#8221; he answered slowly, &#8220;it would
be not to ask any questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t consider it very inquisitive to want to
know what I&#8217;m shipping on,&#8221; he returned with some
heat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye said ye wanted t&#8217; git somewhere near Carlina,
didn&#8217;t ye?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; ye said ye didn&#8217;t care how you gut there so
long&#8217;s ye gut there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; admitted Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&ndash;&ndash;ye&#8217;re on yer way to Carlina now. An&#8217;
if we ain&#8217;t blown t&#8217; hell, as likely &#8217;nuff we will be, an&#8217;
if we don&#8217;t all git our bloomin&#8217; throats cut like I
dreamed &#8217;bout, er if the ship ain&#8217;t scuttled as we&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
have a precious crew who &#8217;u&#8217;d do it in a second, we&#8217;ll
git there.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused as though expecting some reply, but
already Wilson had lost interest in his query before
other speculations of warmer interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the meanwhile,&#8221; ran on Stubbs, &#8220;&#8217;tain&#8217;t
bad right here. Shouldn&#8217;t wonder though but
what we gut an old hellion of a thunder shower &#8217;fore
long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you figure that out without a cloud in
the sky?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t figure it out. Don&#8217;t ever figure nothin&#8217; out,
&#8217;cause nothin&#8217; ever comes out right. Only sech things
is jus&#8217; my luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>He puffed a moment at his pipe, and then, removing
it, turned to the young man beside him with
a renewed interest which seemed to be the result of
his meditation.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, m&#8217; boy, I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; that if you and I
c&#8217;uld sorter pull together on this trip it &#8217;u&#8217;d be a good
thing fer us both. I reckon I&#8217;ll need a man or two
at my side what I can depend upon, and maybe you&#8217;ll
find one come in handy, too. Ye&#8217;ll find me square,
but damned unlucky. As fer you, it&#8217;s clear to see
you&#8217;re square &#8217;nuff. I like a man at the start or I
don&#8217;t like him ever. I like <i>you</i>, an&#8217; if it&#8217;s agreeable
we can strike articles of &#8217;greement to pull together, as
<i>you</i> might say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson listened in some surprise at this unexpected
turn in the attitude of his friend, but he could not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
doubt the man&#8217;s sincerity. He extended his hand at
once, responding heartily,</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you. We ought to be able to help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve gotter work a little longer in the dark, m&#8217;
boy, &#8217;cause it isn&#8217;t for me to tell another man&#8217;s business.
But I&#8217;ve looked inter this and so far&#8217;s I can see
it is all right and above board. It&#8217;s onusual an&#8217; I&#8217;m
not bankin&#8217; much on how it&#8217;ll come out, but we don&#8217;t
have to worry none over that. Ye&#8217;ll have a captain
whose got more heart than head maybe, which is diff&#8217;rent
from most captains who useter sail down here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing to take what comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only way. Wrastle it out each day and,
win er lose, forgit it in yer sleep. We all reaches
the same port in the end.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sun beat down warmly on the two men, the
blue waves danced merrily before their eyes, and just
beyond the good ship rode at anchor, rising and falling
rhythmically. Already the city seemed hundreds of
miles behind to Wilson, although he had only to turn
his head to see it. Whether it was the salt, sea air
or the smack of many lands which clung to the man
at his side, he felt himself in another world, a world
of broader, looser laws.</p>
<p>&#8220;In about an hour,&#8221; drawled Stubbs, &#8220;the others
will be here. There&#8217;ll be all kinds, I expect; some
of &#8217;em sober, some of &#8217;em drunk; some of &#8217;em cool,
some of &#8217;em scared; some of &#8217;em willing, some of &#8217;em
balky. But all of &#8217;em has gotter git aboard that
vessel. An&#8217; you and me has gotter do it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></div>
<p>&#8220;How many?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe fifty; maybe more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty good handful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be if we didn&#8217;t start first. So it&#8217;s jus&#8217;
as well&ndash;&ndash;not that we&#8217;re lookin&#8217; fer trouble or even
expectin&#8217; it, as you may say, but jus&#8217; to nip trouble in
the bud, as the sayin&#8217; is,&ndash;&ndash;to look at our weapins.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew out his own heavy Colt&#8217;s revolver, removed
the cartridges, tested the hammer, and refilled the
chambers. Out of the corner of his eye he watched
Wilson to see that he was equally careful. The latter
could not help but smile a little. He felt more as
though he were on the stage than in real life. To be
preparing for as much trouble as though in some uncivilized
country, while still within sight of the office
buildings of a modern city, seemed an absurdity.
Yet here he was, in his sober senses, and at his side
sat Stubbs, and, behind, the big chimneys belched
smoke, while he thrust one cartridge after another
into the bright cylinder of his weapon. But when
he looked again at the ocean which lay before him
an unbroken plain extending to the shores of other
continents, his act and his situation seemed more
natural. He was preparing for the things before him,
not the life behind. The waters breaking at their feet
were brothers to those many thousands of miles
distant.</p>
<p>The sun sank lower and lower towards the blue
horizon line, finally spattering the sky with color as
it sank into the sea as though it had splashed into a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
pot of molten gold. Behind them the whistles
screamed that work might cease. In front, where
there were no roads or paths to cut the blue, the only
surface whereon man has not been able to leave his
mark since the first created day, a deep peace came
down. The world became almost a dream world, so
hushed and vague it grew. The yacht which still
rocked at anchor grew as dim as a ghost ship. The
purple of the sky deepened and the stars came out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at her now,&#8221; drawled Stubbs, with a sweep
of his hand towards the waters, &#8220;like an infant in
arms, but afore mornin&#8217; reachin&#8217; for yer throat,
maybe. Next to wimen I don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose there&#8217;s anythin&#8217;
so uncertain and contrary, as you may say.&#8221;</p>
<p>He raised his field glasses and studied the ship
again which lay without lights, like a derelict. He
rose lazily and stretched himself.</p>
<p>The light glow in the west disappeared and left the
earth but scantily lighted by a new moon. The surface
of the water was dark, so that from the shore a rowboat
could not be seen for a distance of more than fifty
yards. Stubbs strolled towards the place where they
had landed and took from his black bag a small lantern
which he lighted and, after some searching, placed
upon a small, flat rock which he discovered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess that will fetch &#8217;em &#8217;fore long,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But it was all of half an hour before the first boat
came stealing out of the dark like a floating log. At
sight of it Stubbs became a different man. He rose to
his feet with the quick movement of a boy. His eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
took in every detail of the contents of the boat before
it touched the shore. He was as alert as a watchdog.
He turned to Wilson before he started towards this
first cargo.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Member,&#8221; he warned,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;jus&#8217; one thing to do,&ndash;&ndash;git
&#8217;em aboard the ship yonder. If they git scared
and balky, tell &#8217;em they gut ter go now. Hol&#8217; yerself
steady and talk sharp.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boat, a large fishing dory, scraped the sand.
It appeared loaded to the gunwales with the men and
their kits. It had scarcely grounded before there was
a scramble among the occupants and a fight to get
ashore.</p>
<p>But once they had secured their traps, they gathered
into a surly group and swore their discontent at the
whole expedition. Into the midst of this Stubbs
stamped and under pretence of gruff greeting to this
one and that, together with much elbowing, broke the
circle up into three parts. A dozen questions were
shot at him, but he answered them with an assumption
of authority that had a wholesome effect. In another
minute he had picked out three of the most aggressive
men and stationed them at different points on the
island to look out for the other boats.</p>
<p>They came rapidly, and within half an hour the list
was complete.</p>
<p>Wilson found that he was in about as tough a company
as ever stepped out of a pirate story. They had
evidently all been chosen with a regard for their physique,
for they were all powerfully built men, ranging
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
in age from twenty to forty. Most of them were only
loafers about the wharves. There was not a seafaring
man among them, for reasons which later were obvious
enough to Wilson. It was clear that few of them were
pleased with the first stage of their expedition, but
they were forced to take it out in swearing. They
swore at the dark, at the cold sea air, at the sand, at
their luck, and, below their breath, at Stubbs, who had
got them here. Two of them were drunk and sang
maudlin songs in each other&#8217;s arms. But out of the
grumbling babel of voices one question predominated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha&#8217; th&#8217; hell does this mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>Stubbs with a paper in his hand checked off the contents
of each boat as it arrived, strode into the heart
of every group as it got too noisy, turned aside all
questions with an oath or a laugh, and in ten minutes
had convinced every man that for the present they were
under the whip hand of a master. They quieted down
after this and, slouching into the sand, lighted their
pipes and waited. Wilson was stationed to overlook
the empty boats and see that no one but the oarsmen
departed in them.</p>
<p>He took his post with a nonchalance that surprised
himself. It was as though he had been accustomed to
such incidents all his life. When one of the bullies
swaggered down and said with an oath that he&#8217;d be
damned if he&#8217;d have any more of it and lifted one
foot into a boat, Wilson touched him lightly upon the
shoulder and ordered him back.</p>
<p>The man turned and squared his shoulders for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
blow. But the hand upon his shoulder remained, and
even in the dusk he saw that the eyes continued unflinchingly
upon him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get back,&#8221; said Wilson, quietly.</p>
<p>The man turned, and without a word slunk to his
place among his fellows. Wilson watched him as curiously
as though he had been merely a bystander. And
yet when he realized that the man had done his bidding,
had done it because he feared to do otherwise,
he felt a tingling sense of some new power. It was
a feeling of physical individuality&ndash;&ndash;a consciousness
of manhood in the arms and legs and back. To him
man had until now been purely a creature of the intellect
gauged by his brain capacity. Here where the arm
counted he found himself taking possession of some
fresh nature within him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take the lantern,&#8221; shouted Stubbs; &#8220;go to where
we sat and wave it three times, slow like, back and
forth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson obeyed. Almost instantly he saw a launch
steal from the ship&#8217;s side and make directly for the
island.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, men,&#8221; commanded Stubbs, &#8220;take your kits,
get into fours and march to the left.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a shove here, a warning there, he moulded the
scattered groups into a fairly orderly line. Then he
directed them by twos into the small boat from the
launch, which had come as far inshore as possible.
Wilson stood opposite and kept the line intact. There
was no trouble. The launch made two trips, and on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
the last Stubbs and Wilson clambered in, leaving the
island as deserted as the ocean in their wake. Stubbs
wiped his forehead with a red bandanna handkerchief
and lighted up his short clay pipe with a sigh
of relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;So far, so good,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The only thing you
can bank on is what&#8217;s over with. There&#8217;s several of
them gents I should hate to meet on a dark night, an&#8217;
the same will bear steady watchin&#8217; on this trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>He squatted in the stern, calmly facing the clouded
faces with the air of a laborer who has completed
a good day&#8217;s work. As they came alongside the ship
he instructed each man how to mount the swaying rope
ladder and watched them solicitously until they clambered
over the side.</p>
<p>Most of them took this as an added insult and swore
roundly at it as an imposition.</p>
<p>Wilson himself found it no easy task to reach the
deck, but Stubbs came up the ladder as nimbly as a
cat. The ship was unlighted from bow to stern, so
that the men aboard her moved about like shadows.
Wilson was rescued from the hold by Stubbs, who drew
him back just as he was being shoved towards the
hatch by one of the sailors. The next second he found
himself facing a well-built shadow, who greeted Stubbs
with marked satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the Lord,&#8221; exclaimed the man, &#8220;you&#8217;ve done
well, Stubbs. How many did you get in all?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifty&ndash;&ndash;to a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They looked husky in the dark.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they&#8217;ve gut beef &#8217;nuff&ndash;&ndash;but that ain&#8217;t all
that makes a man. Howsomever, they&#8217;re as good as
I expected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson gasped; the master of this strange craft
was no other than Danbury!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3><i>Of Love and Queens</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">For</span> a few minutes Wilson kept in the background.
He saw that the young man was in command and
apparently knew what he was about, for one order
followed another, succeeded by a quick movement of
silent figures about the decks, a jingle of bells below,
and soon the metallic clank of the steam-driven windlass.
Shortly after this he felt the pulse beat of the
engines below, and then saw the ship, as gently as
a maid picking her way across a muddy street, move
slowly ahead into the dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Danbury to Stubbs, &#8220;hold your breath.
If we can only slide by the lynx-eyed quarantine
officers, we&#8217;ll have a straight road ahead of us for a
while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we&#8217;ll do it; maybe we won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You damned pessimist,&#8221; laughed Danbury.
&#8220;Once we&#8217;re out of this harbor I&#8217;ll give you a feed
that will make an optimist of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The black smoke, sprinkled with golden red sparks
from the forced draft, belched from the funnel tops.
The ship slid by the green and red lights of other
craft with never a light of her own. The three men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
stood there until the last beacon was passed and the
boat was pointed for the open.</p>
<p>&#8220;Done!&#8221; exclaimed Danbury. &#8220;Now we&#8217;ll have
our lights and sail like men. Hanged if I like that
trick of muffled lights; but it would be too long a delay
to be held up here until morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spoke a moment to his mate, and then turned
to Stubbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;come on and I&#8217;ll make you glad
you&#8217;re living.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a moment, Cap&#8217;n&ndash;&ndash;my mate Wilson.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danbury turned sharply. In the light which now
flooded up from below, he saw Wilson&#8217;s features quite
clearly, but for a moment he could not believe his
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the devil&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he began, then broke in abruptly,
&#8220;Are you the same one&ndash;&ndash;the fellow in the
Oriental robe and bandaged head?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The same,&#8221; answered Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;The one I took from the crowd and brought
home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And clothed and loaned ten dollars, for which he
is more thankful than ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;did you get the girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; answered Wilson. &#8220;I&#8217;m still after
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&ndash;&ndash;but say, come on down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danbury led the way into a small cabin so brilliant
with the reflection of the electric lights against the
spotless white woodwork that it was almost blinding.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
But it was a welcome change from the dark and the
cool night air and the discomfort of the last few hours.
To Wilson it was almost like a feat of magic to have
been shifted in an hour from the barren sands of the
tiny island to such luxury as this. It took but the
first glance to perceive that this young captain had not
been limited in resources in the furnishing of his ship.
Within the small compass of a stateroom he had compressed
comfort and luxury. Yet there was no ostentation
or vulgarity displayed. The owner had been
guided by the one desire for decent ease and a certain
regard for the eye. The left side of the room was
occupied by the two bunks made up with the immaculate
neatness characterizing all things aboard a good
ship. The center of the room, was now filled with a
folding table set with an array of silver, fine linen,
and exquisite glass which would have done credit to
the best board in New York. Beneath the group of
electric lights it fairly sparkled and glistened as though
it were ablaze. The wall to the right was adorned
with a steel engraving of a thoroughbred bull pup.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Danbury, throwing himself into a
chair, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to know how in thunder Stubbs got
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;I got Stubbs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But where&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the pier,&#8221; broke in Stubbs, &#8220;where I had gone
with the note to your pal&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; may I drop dead if he
don&#8217;t give me the creeps. There I finds this gent&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217;
I takes &#8217;em where I finds &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You got the note to Valverde all right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I got the note to your long-legged friend, but&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s
his eyes, man! It&#8217;s his eyes! They ain&#8217;t human!
I seen a man like him once what went mad from the
heat an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he lowered his voice, &#8220;they found him
at his mate&#8217;s throat a-sucking of his blood!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; exploded Danbury. &#8220;No more of your
ghastly yarns! Val is going to be useful to me or&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m
darned if I could stand him. I don&#8217;t like him
after dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They shines in the dark like a cat&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;them eyes
does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Drop it, Stubbs! Drop it! I want to forget
him for a while. That isn&#8217;t telling me how you
chanced&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it,&#8221; interrupted Wilson. &#8220;It was
chance. I was looking for an opportunity to get to
Carlina, and by inspiration was led to ask Stubbs.
He made the proposition that I come with him, and
I came. I had no more idea of seeing you than my
great-grandfather. I was going back to thank you,
but one thing has followed another so swiftly that I
hadn&#8217;t the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, I know. But if you really want to thank
me, you must tell me all about it some day. If things
hadn&#8217;t been coming so fast my own way I should have
lain awake nights guessing about you. If I could
have picked out one man I wanted on this trip with me
I&#8217;d have taken a chance on you. The way you stood
off that crowd made a hit with me. I don&#8217;t know what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
sort of a deal you&#8217;ve made with Stubbs, but I&#8217;ll make
one of my own with you after dinner. Now about the
others. No shanghaiing, was there, Stubbs? Every
man knows where he&#8217;s going and what he&#8217;s hired
for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They will afore they&#8217;re through.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danbury&#8217;s face darkened.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ve been overzealous. I won&#8217;t
have a man on board against his will, if I have to
sail back to port with him. But once he&#8217;s decided for
himself,&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll be damned if he turns yellow safely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ve gotter remember,&#8221; said Stubbs, &#8220;that
they&#8217;re a pack er liars, every mother&#8217;s son of &#8217;em.
Maybe they&#8217;ll say they was shanghaied; maybe they
won&#8217;t. But I&#8217;ve got fifty papers to show they&#8217;re
liars &#8217;cause they&#8217;ve put their names to th&#8217; bottom of
every paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And they were sober when they did it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t been lookin&#8217; arter their morals or their
personal habits,&#8221; replied Stubbs, with some disgust.
&#8220;As fer their turnin&#8217; yeller&ndash;&ndash;mos&#8217; men are yeller
until they are afraid not ter be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it. I don&#8217;t believe it,&ndash;&ndash;not Americans.
And that&#8217;s one thing I insisted upon,&ndash;&ndash;they
are all Americans?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every mother&#8217;s son of &#8217;em swore they was. Not
bein&#8217; present at their birth&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll look &#8217;em over to-morrow and I&#8217;ll have
a talk with them. I&#8217;m going to put it up to them
squarely&ndash;&ndash;good pay for good fighters. By the Lord,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
Stubbs, I can&#8217;t realize yet that we&#8217;re actually on the
way. Think of it,&ndash;&ndash;in less than a month we&#8217;ll be
at it!&#8221;</p>
<p>The dinner would have done credit to the Waldorf.</p>
<p>It was towards its end that Togo, the Japanese
steward, came in with a silver-topped bottle in a pail
of ice. He filled the three glasses with the flourish of
a man who has put a period to the end of a successful
composition. Danbury arose. &#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he said,
raising his glass, &#8220;I have a toast to propose: to Her
health and Her throne.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men rose, Wilson mystified, and silently
drained their glasses. Then there was the tinkle of
shivered glass as Danbury, after the manner of the
English in drinking to their Queen, hurled the fragile
crystal to the floor. Shortly after this Stubbs left the
two men to go below and look after his charges. Danbury
brought out a bottle of Scotch and a siphon of
soda and, lighting his brierwood pipe, settled back
comfortably on the bunk with his head bolstered up
with pillows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to know just as much
of your story as you want to tell&ndash;&ndash;just as much as
you feel like telling, and not another word. Maybe
you&#8217;re equally curious about me; if so, I&#8217;ll tell you
something of that afterwards. There&#8217;s pipes, cigars,
and cigarettes&ndash;&ndash;take your choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson felt that he was under certain obligations
to tell something of himself, but in addition to this he
really felt a desire to confide in someone. It would be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
a relief. The fact remained, however, that as yet he
really knew nothing of Danbury and so must move
cautiously. He told him of the incident in his life
which led to his leaving school, of his failure to find
work in Boston, of his adventure in helping the girl
to escape, which led to the house. Here he confined
himself to the arrival of the owner, of his wound, and
of the attack made upon him in the house. He told of
his search through the dark house, of the closed cellar
door, and of the blow in the head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone bundled me into a carriage, and I came
to on the way to the hospital. It was the next day,
after I awoke in my cot and persuaded them to let me
out, that I had the good luck to run into you. My
clothes had been left in the house and all I had was
the lounging robe which I had put on early in the
evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you had your nerve to dare venture out in that
rig!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to get back to the house. The girl didn&#8217;t
know where I had gone, and, for all I knew, was at
the mercy of the same madman who struck me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right&ndash;&ndash;you had to do it. But honestly,
I would rather have met twenty more maniacs in the
dark than go out upon the street in that Jap juggler
costume of yours. What happened after you left
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson told of the empty house, of finding the
note, of locating the other house, and finally of the
letter and his race for the wharf.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And then I ran into Stubbs and landed here,&#8221; he
concluded.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did Stubbs tell you of this expedition?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing&ndash;&ndash;except that we are running to Carlina.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; sighed Danbury, dreamily, &#8220;to Carlina.
Well, things certainly <i>have</i> been coming fast for you
these last few days. And I&#8217;ll tell you right now that
when we reach Carlina if you need me or any of this
crew to help you get the girl, you can count on us.
We&#8217;ve got a pretty good job of our own cut out, but
perhaps the two will work together.&#8221;</p>
<p>He relighted his pipe, adjusted thyhe pillows more
comfortably, and with hands clasped behind his head
began his own story.</p>
<p>&#8220;To go back a little,&#8221; he said, &#8220;father made a pot
of money in coffee&ndash;&ndash;owned two or three big plantations
down around Rio; but he had no sooner got a
comfortable pile together than he died. That&#8217;s way
back just about as far as I can remember. As a kid
I wasn&#8217;t very strong, and so cut out school mostly&ndash;&ndash;got
together a few scraps of learning under a tutor,
but never went to college. Instead of that, the mater
let me knock around. She&#8217;s the best ever that way,
is the mater&ndash;&ndash;tends to her Bridge, gives me an open
account, and, so long as she hears once a month, is
happy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last year I took a little trip down to Dad&#8217;s plantations,
and from there rounded the Horn on a sailing
vessel and landed way up the west coast in Carlina.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
It was just chance that led me to get off there and push
in to Bogova. I&#8217;d heard of gold mines in there and
thought I&#8217;d have a look at them. But before I came
to the gold mines I found something else.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused a moment. Then, without a word, rose
slowly and, fumbling about a moment in a cedar chest
near his bunk, drew out a photograph.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s she,&#8221; he said laconically.</p>
<p>Wilson saw the features of a girl of twenty, a good
profile of rather a Southern cast, and a certain poise
of the head which marked her as one with generations
of equally good features back of her.</p>
<p>If not decidedly beautiful, she was most attractive,
giving an impression of an independent nature enlivened
with humor. It seemed to Wilson that she
might furnish a very good balance to Danbury.</p>
<p>&#8220;You lose the best part of her,&#8221; said Danbury, reseating
himself on the bunk. &#8220;You can&#8217;t see the eyes
and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Danbury roused himself and sat on the edge of the
bunk leaning far forward, elbows on knees, gazing
steadily at Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, those eyes do keep a fellow up, don&#8217;t they?
I had only to see them once to know that I&#8217;d fight
for them as long as I lived. Queer what a girl&#8217;s eyes&ndash;&ndash;<i>the</i>
girl&#8217;s eyes&ndash;&ndash;will do. I&#8217;ll never forget that
first time. She was sitting in one of those palm-filled
caf&eacute;s where the sun sprinkles in across the floor. She
was dressed in black, not a funeral black, but one of
those fluffy things that make cr&ecirc;pe look like royal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
purple. She had a rose, a long-stemmed rose, in her
bodice, and one of those Spanish lace things over her
hair. I can see her now,&ndash;&ndash;almost reach out and
touch her. I went in and took a table not far away
and ordered a drink. Then I watched her out of the
corner of my eye. She was with an older woman, and,
say&ndash;&ndash;she didn&#8217;t see a man in that whole room. As
far as they were concerned they might have been so
many flies buzzing round among the palms. Then a
couple of government officers lounged in and caught
sight of her. They all know her down there &#8217;cause she
is of the blood royal. Her grandmother&#8217;s sister was
the last queen and was murdered in cold blood. Yes,
sir, and there weren&#8217;t men enough there to get up and
shoot the bunch who did it. Pretty soon these fellows
began to get fresh. She didn&#8217;t mind them, but after
standing it as long as she decently could, she rose and
prepared to go out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go out, with an American in the place? Not
much! There was a row, and at the end of it they
carried the two officers off on a stretcher. Then they
pinched me and it cost me $500 to get out.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it gave me the chance to meet her later
on and learn all about how she had been cheated
out of her throne. You see the trouble was that
republics had been started all around Carlina,&ndash;&ndash;they
grow down there like mushrooms,&ndash;&ndash;so that
soon some of these chumps thought they must go and
do the same thing, although everything was going
finely and they were twice as prosperous under their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
queen as the other fellows were under their grafting
presidents. Then one of the wild-eyed ones stabbed
Queen Marguerite, her grandaunt, you know, and the
game was on. Isn&#8217;t it enough to make your blood
boil? As a matter of fact, the whole blamed shooting-match
wouldn&#8217;t make a state the size of Rhode Island,
so it isn&#8217;t worth much trouble except for the honor of
the thing. There is a bunch of men down there who
have kept the old traditions alive by going out into
the streets and shooting up the city hall every now and
then, but they&#8217;ve mostly got shot themselves for their
pains,&ndash;&ndash;which hasn&#8217;t done the princess any good.
I studied the situation, and the more I thought of her
getting done in this way, the madder I got. So I made
up my mind she should have her old throne back. She
said she didn&#8217;t want it, but that was only because she
didn&#8217;t want me to get mixed up in it. At first it did
look like a kind of dubious enterprise, but I prowled
around and then I discovered a trump card. Up in
the hills there is a bunch of wild Indians who have
always balked at a republic, mostly because the republic
tried to clean them out just to keep the army
in practice.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the Chief, the Grand Mogul and priest of
them all, is this same man Stubbs doesn&#8217;t like&ndash;&ndash;the
same who, for some devilish reason of his own chose
this particular time to sail for South America. But
he isn&#8217;t a bad lot, this Valverde, though he <i>is</i> a queer
one. He speaks English like a native and has ways
that at times make me think he is half American. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
he isn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;he is a heathen clear to his backbone, with
a heathen heart and a heathen temper. When he takes
a dislike to a man he&#8217;s going to make it hot for him
some day or other. It seems that he is particularly
sore against the government now because of a certain
expedition sent up there a little over a year ago, and
because of the loss of a heathen idol which&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; broke in Wilson, half rising from his
chair. &#8220;Is this&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The priest, they all call him. Mention the priest
down there and they knew whom you mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said Wilson, breathing a bit more rapidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know him? Maybe you caught a glimpse
of him that day you were at the house. He was
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t know him,&#8221; answered Wilson, &#8220;but&ndash;&ndash;but
I have heard of him. It seems that he is
everywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a queer one. He can get from one place to
another more quickly and with less noise than anyone
I ever met. He&#8217;s a bit uncanny that way as well as
other ways. However, as I said, he&#8217;s been square with
me and it didn&#8217;t take us long to get together on a
proposition for combining our interests; I to furnish
guns, ammunition, and as many men as possible, he to
fix up a deal with the old party, do the scheming, and
furnish a few hundred Indians. I&#8217;ve had the boat
all ready for a long while, and Stubbs, one of Dad&#8217;s
old skippers, out for men. Yesterday he jumped at
me from Carlina, where I thought he was, 10,000 miles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
away by sea, and gave the word. Now he is off again
on the Columba and is to meet me in Choco Bay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danbury relighted his pipe and added between puffs
over the match:</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you know the whole story and where we&#8217;re
going. Are you with us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Wilson, &#8220;I am with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>But his head was whirling. Who was this man who
struck at him in the dark, and with whom he was now
joined in an expedition against Carlina? One thing
was sure; that if the priest was on the boat with Sorez
it boded ill for the latter. It was possible the girl
might never reach Carlina.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now for terms. I&#8217;ll give you twenty a week and
your keep to fight this out with me. Is it a bargain?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shake on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson shook. Danbury rang for the steward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Togo&ndash;&ndash;a bottle. We must drink to her health.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3><i>Of Powder and Bullets</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">Day</span> after day of the long voyage passed without
incident. Danbury and Wilson in the close
relationship necessary aboard ship grew to be warm
friends. And yet the latter still remained silent concerning
that part of his quest relating to the hidden
treasure. This was not so much due to any remaining
suspicion of Danbury as to the fact that the latter
seemed so occupied with his own interests. In fact,
he was tempted far more to confide in Stubbs. The
latter would be an ideal partner on such a search. As
the days passed he became more and more convinced
that it would be to his advantage to enlist the services
of Stubbs even upon as big a basis as share and share
alike.</p>
<p>Danbury trod the decks each day with a light step,
and at night relieved his buoyant heart of its dreams
to Wilson and of its plans to Stubbs. The latter had
spoken once or twice of the necessity of finding something
for the men below to do, but Danbury had waved
aside the suggestion with a good-natured &#8220;Let &#8217;em
loaf.&#8221; But finally their grumblings and complainings
grew so loud that Stubbs was forced to take some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
notice of it, and so, upon his own responsibility, had
them up on deck where he put them through a form
of drill. But they rebelled at this and at last reached
a condition which threatened to become serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve jus&#8217; got to find something for them to do,&#8221;
Stubbs informed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;They ought certainly to be kept in trim. Don&#8217;t
want them to get flabby.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Nother thing, they are livin&#8217; too high,&#8221; said
Stubbs. &#8220;Salt pork and hardtack is what they needs,&ndash;&ndash;not
beefsteak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Stubbs. This isn&#8217;t a slave-ship. Nothing
like good fodder to keep &#8217;em in trim. They are
getting just what you get at a training table, and I
know what that does,&ndash;&ndash;keeps you fit as a king.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe so. I&#8217;ll tell you what it&#8217;ull do for them,&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;ll
inspire &#8217;em to cut our bonny throats some day.
The ale alone &#8217;ud do it. Think of servin&#8217; ale to sech
as them with nothin&#8217; to do but sit in the sun. Darned
if they ain&#8217;t gettin&#8217; to look as chubby as them babies
you see in the advertisements. An&#8217; their tempers is
growin&#8217; likewise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good fightin&#8217; spirit, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; drawled Stubbs, &#8220;an&#8217; a hell of a bad thing
to have on the high seas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Danbury, after a moment&#8217;s thought,
&#8220;you have them up on deck to-morrow and I&#8217;ll have
a talk with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Danbury&#8217;s first opportunity to look over his
mercenaries as a whole and he gave a gasp of surprise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
at the row after row of villainous faces raised with
sneering grins to his. Well in the front squatted
&#8220;Bum&#8221; Jocelin, known to the water-front police for
fifteen years,&ndash;&ndash;six feet of threatening insolence;
&#8220;Black&#8221; Morrison with two penitentiary sentences
back of him; and &#8220;Splinter&#8221; Mallory, thin, leering,
shifty. And yet Danbury, after he had recovered himself
a bit, saw in their very ugliness the fighting spirit
of the bulldog. He had not hired them for ornament
but for the very lawlessness which led them rather to
fight for what they wished than to work for it. Doubtless
below their flannel shirts they all had hearts which
beat warmly. So he met their gaze frankly and, raising
one foot to a capstan, he bent forward with a smile
and began. Stubbs stood by with the strained expression
of a father who stands helpless watching a son do
a foolish thing. On the other hand, Wilson, though
he would not have done it himself, rather admired the
spirit that prompted the act.</p>
<p>&#8220;Men,&#8221; began Danbury,&ndash;&ndash;and Stubbs choked back
an exclamation at his gentleness,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;men, I haven&#8217;t told
you much about the errand upon which you are bound,
but I feel now that you ought to know. You signed for
two months and agreed to accept your orders from me.
You were told there would be some scrapping&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The hell we were,&#8221; broke in Splinter. Danbury,
ignoring the interruption, blandly continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;And you were all picked out as men who wouldn&#8217;t
balk at a bit of a mix-up. But you weren&#8217;t told what
it is all about.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, this is the game: down there in Carlina
where we are going there is a one-horse republic
where they used to have a dinky little kingdom. A
republic is all right when it&#8217;s an honest republic,
but this one isn&#8217;t. It was stolen, and stolen from
the finest woman in the world. I&#8217;m going to give
you all a chance to see her some day, and I know
you&#8217;ll throw up your hats then and say the game is
worth it, if you don&#8217;t before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their faces were as stolid as though they could not
understand a word of what he was saying. But he
had lost sight of them and saw only the eyes of the
girl of whom he was speaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once, when she was a little girl, they put her in
prison. And it wasn&#8217;t a man&#8217;s prison either, but a
mangy, low-down, dog kennel. Think of it! Put her
down there in the dark among the rats. But that was
too much for the decent ones of even that crowd, and
they had to let her go. So now she lives in a little house
in her kingdom, like a beggar outside her own door.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danbury had worked himself up to a fever pitch.
His words came hoarsely and he stepped nearer in his
excitement. But as he paused once more, he realized
that he was facing a pack of dummies. For a moment
he stared at them in amazement. Then he burst out,</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you with us, men? Haven&#8217;t we something
worth fighting for&ndash;&ndash;something worth fighting hard
for?&#8221;</p>
<p>He heard a rough guffaw from a few men in the
rear; then a voice:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the dough we&#8217;re out fer&ndash;&ndash;no damned
princess.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danbury whitened. He leaped forward as though
to throw himself into the midst of them all, and reached
for the throat of the man who had spoken. But
Stubbs who had been watching, drew his revolver,
and followed close behind. With the aid of Wilson he
separated the two and drew off Danbury, while keeping
the others at bay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go below,&#8221; he commanded. &#8220;Let me talk to &#8217;em
a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;but the damned jellyfish&ndash;&ndash;the&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson seized his arm and managed to drag him
away and down to his cabin. Then Stubbs, with feet
wide apart, faced the gang. His voice was low, but
they did not miss a word.</p>
<p>&#8220;Th&#8217; cap&#8217;n,&#8221; he began, &#8220;has talked to ye as though
ye was white men &#8217;cause he&#8217;s young and clean an&#8217;
doesn&#8217;t know the likes of ye. He hain&#8217;t had so much
to do with a bunch of white-livered, swill-tub jail
birds as I have. But don&#8217;t you go further an&#8217; make
th&#8217; mistake thet &#8217;cause he&#8217;s young he ain&#8217;t a man yet.
&#8217;Cause if ye do, ye&#8217;ll wake up sudden with a jolt.
Even if he did mistake a pack of yaller dogs fer men,
don&#8217;t ye think he doesn&#8217;t know how to handle yaller
dogs. But I s&#8217;pose ye are jus&#8217; as good to shoot at
as better. Now I gut ye aboard this craft&ndash;&ndash;me,
Stubbs,&#8221; he pointed to his breast with a thick forefinger,
&#8220;an&#8217; ye&#8217;re goneter earn yer grub afore ye&#8217;re
done.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Shanghaied&ndash;&ndash;we was shanghaied,&#8221; ventured
Splinter.</p>
<p>&#8220;You was, was ye? D&#8217; ye think ye could make
anyone b&#8217;lieve a man in his sober senses would shanghai
the likes of you? But howsomever that may be, here
you is and here you stays till ye git ashore. Then you
has yer chi&#8217;ce er gittin&#8217; shot in front er gittin&#8217; shot
behind,&ndash;&ndash;gittin&#8217; shot like white men er gittin&#8217; shot
like niggers. &#8217;Cause I tells you right now thet in all
the shootin&#8217;, I&#8217;ll be hangin&#8217; round where I can spot
the first man who goes the wrong way. An&#8217;,&#8221; he drew
his weapon from his pocket, &#8220;I can shoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>He placed a bullet within two inches of the hand of
a man who was leaning against the rail. The group
huddled more closely together like frightened sheep.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he concluded, &#8220;ye&#8217;re goneter git more
exercise an&#8217; less grub arter this. Tuck it away fer
future ref&#8217;rence thet th&#8217; next time yer cap&#8217;n talks to
yer ye&#8217;d better show a little life. Now, jus&#8217; ter prove
ye appreciate what he said, cheer. An&#8217; cheer good, ye
dogs.&#8221;</p>
<p>They let out a howl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now back to yer kennels!&#8221;</p>
<p>They slunk away, crowding one another in their
effort to get from the range of the weapon which Stubbs
still carelessly held pointed at their heels.</p>
<p>It was several days after this that Wilson was pacing
the deck alone one night rather later than usual. The
sky was filled with big, top-heavy clouds which rolled
across the purple, blotting out every now and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
the half moon which sprinkled the sea with silver
butterflies. The yacht quivered as though straining
every timber, but it looked to Wilson a hopeless task
ever to run out from under the dark cup and unchanging
circumference. It seemed as though one might
go on this path through eternity with the silver butterflies
ever fluttering ahead into the boundless dark.</p>
<p>He lounged up to Martin at the wheel. The latter,
a sturdy, somewhat reserved man, appeared glad to
see him and showed evidence of being disturbed about
something. He frequently glanced up from the lighted
compass before the wheel as though on the point of
speaking, but turned back to his task each time,
reconsidering his impulse. Finally he cleared his
throat and remarked with a fine show of indifference,
&#8220;Everything been all quiet below, to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So far as I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Been down there lately?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but the men seemed this morning in unusually
good form. More cheerful than they&#8217;ve been at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a few moments he appeared engrossed in his
work, turning the creaking wheel to the right, the left,
and finally steadying it on its true course. Wilson
waited. The man had said enough to excite his interest
and he knew the best way to induce him to
talk more freely was to keep silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Happened to go for&#8217;ard afore my shift to-night
an&#8217; I heard some of &#8217;em talkin&#8217;. Didn&#8217;t sound to me
like th&#8217; sorter talk that&#8217;s good aboard ship.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></div>
<p>&#8220;So? What were they saying?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; much,&#8221; he answered, frightened back
into stubborn silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;They talk pretty free at all times,&#8221; returned
Wilson. &#8220;They haven&#8217;t learned much about ship
discipline.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hopes they don&#8217;t act as free as they talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No fear of that, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another long silence. Then Martin asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the ammunition stowed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We had it moved the other day to the vacant
cabins just beyond our quarters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every cartridge. Why do you ask that, Martin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I happened to go for&#8217;ard afore my shift,&#8221; he
repeated.</p>
<p>Wilson arose and stepped to his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, if you heard anything unusual, I&#8217;d like
to know it before I turn in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My business is a-workin&#8217; of this wheel, an&#8217; what
I says is we&#8217;ve gut a damned bad cargo.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson smiled. After all, it was probably only the
constitutional jealousy that always exists between a
seaman and a landsman.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Martin, only we&#8217;re all in the same
kettle. Keep your ears open, and if you hear anything
definite let me know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I says I puts my chest agin my door afore
I sleeps an&#8217; I watches out for shadows when I&#8217;m at
the wheel.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And have you seen any to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, an&#8217; I hopes I won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Good night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson stepped out of the pilot-house and made a
short round of the ship. He even ventured down to
the forward hold, but all was as quiet there as ever.
He turned towards his own cabin. Danbury&#8217;s light
was out. Beyond he saw the form of the first mate
who had been posted there to guard the ammunition.
He spoke to him and received a cordial reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;All quiet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All quiet, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>The door of Stubbs&#8217; cabin was closed, and he heard
within his heavy snoring. He entered his own cabin
and closed the door. But he felt uneasy and restless.
Instead of undressing he threw himself down on the
bunk, after placing his pistol underneath his pillow.
Martin&#8217;s talk had been just suggestive enough to start
his brain to working, disturbed as he was by so many
other things. He had an impulse to rouse Stubbs.
He wanted someone with whom to talk. He would
also have been more comfortable if he had been able
to make sure that those bits of parchment were still
safe in his comrade&#8217;s chest, where he had locked them.
If the crew once got even a suspicion that there was
on board such a golden chance as these offered, it
would be a temptation difficult for even better men
to resist. He realized that if they were able sufficiently
to surrender each his own selfish individual
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
desires and organize compactly under a single leader,
they would form an almost irresistible force. But of
course the key to the whole situation lay in the ammunition.
Without this they were helpless. Knives and
clubs could not resist powder and bullet. He became
drowsy finally and his thoughts wandered once more
to the treasure and then to Jo until his eyes closed
and, though his lips still remained tense, he slept.</p>
<p>He was awakened by the sound of a muffled fall in
the next cabin. He sprang to his feet, seizing his
weapon. The electric light wire had been cut so that
the cabin was in suffocating darkness. By some instinct
he forced himself flat against the wall by the
door. The next second the door was flung open and
two forms hurled themselves with a grunt upon the
bunk. He fired twice and darted out into the passageway.
Here all was confusion, but all was dark. Man
fell against man with oaths and wild threshing of the
arms, but they all knew one another for friends. He
was for the moment safe. The doors to the cabins
of Stubbs and Danbury were wide open. He knew
that either they had escaped by some such miracle as
his, or that they were beyond help. It seemed to him
that there was but one thing to do, make the deck and
collect whatever honest men were left. The mutineers
were still fighting with one another and had grown
so panic-stricken that they were making little progress
towards their goal. Quick action might even now save
the ship. He heard a voice raised in a vain endeavor
to control them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Steady, boys, steady! Wait till we get a light.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the head of the stairs leading to the deck he
found a sentinel. He struck at him and then grappled.
The two rolled on the deck, but the struggle was brief.
Wilson soon had him pinned to the deck. He raised
the fellow&#8217;s head and threw him with all his strength
backwards. The man lay very still after this.</p>
<p>When he rose to his feet the deck was as deserted
as though nothing at all unusual were going on below.
He rushed to the pilot-house. The ship swerved tipsily
and then the engines ceased their throbbing. Martin
lay limply over his wheel. The cutthroats had got
below to the engines.</p>
<p>For a moment his head whirled with twenty impossible
plans. Then he steadied himself. There was
but one thing to do; the gang was evidently so far
in control of the ship as to prevent aid from the
crew; Danbury and Stubbs were doubtless unconscious,
if not dead, and he was left, the one man still
free to act. Once the rifles were loaded a hundred men
could not control this crowd, but before then&ndash;&ndash;one
man with a loaded weapon and with his wits about
him, might make himself master.</p>
<p>He groped his way down the stairs and into the
midst of the tumult. No one had as yet obtained a
light. The leader had succeeded in partly controlling
his gang, but one man had only to brush the shoulder
of another to start a fight. David elbowed through
them, striking right and left in the endeavor to stir
up anew the panic. He succeeded instantly. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
two minutes pandemonium reigned. Then a man
scrambled in with a lantern and was greeted with a
cheer. Wilson turned, shot twice, and ducked. The
cabin was once more in darkness and confusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha&#8217; th&#8217; hell?&#8221; roared Splinter.</p>
<p>Wilson plunged on until he stood facing the door
which still barred the way to the cartridges. It was
intact. At this point someone reached his side with
an axe. Snatching it from the fellow&#8217;s hand he himself
swung it against the lock. He had two things
in mind; the act would turn away suspicion, and
once within the small room, with his back to the
cartridges, he could take the men one by one as
they pressed through the narrow door. He had on
his cartridge belt and ought to be able, not only to
keep them at bay until possible aid arrived from the
crew&#8217;s quarters, but might even be able to start sufficient
panic to drive them out altogether. Wilson
swung a couple of times until the lock weakened.
Splinter shouted:</p>
<p>&#8220;Fer Gawd&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t act like frightened rats!
Keep cool now an&#8217; we have &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>One more blow and the door fell. With a jump
Wilson scrambled in and, turning, fired four times in
rapid succession. In the pause which ensued he refilled
his weapon. There was a chorus of ugly growls
and a concerted movement towards the door. He shot
again, aiming low and relying as much on the flash and
noise to frighten them as on actual killing. To those
without it sounded as though there might be several
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
men. No one knew but what the man next to him had
turned traitor. They groped for one another&#8217;s throats
and finally, as though by one impulse, crowded for the
exit. They fought and pounded and kicked at each
other. It was every man for himself and the Devil
take the hindmost. Wilson helped them along by continued
shooting&ndash;&ndash;aiming high and low. In five minutes
the cabin was cleared save for the wounded, who
managed, however, to drag themselves out of sight.</p>
<p>As Wilson fell back exhausted and half choked from
the smoke with which the room was filled, he heard the
bark of pistols above and knew that the crew had
reached the deck. He waited only long enough to
recover strength to walk, and then moved cautiously
forward. He was undisturbed. The mutineers had
gone, to the last man able to stand. He groped his
way to Danbury&#8217;s cabin and his hand fell upon a limp
form in the bunk. But even as he recoiled the man
moved and muttered feeble queries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you safe, Danbury?&#8221; gasped Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&ndash;&ndash;what&#8217;s the trouble? Give me a drink&ndash;&ndash;brandy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson turned to the wine closet just beyond the
bunk and drew out the first bottle his fingers touched.
He placed it to Danbury&#8217;s lips, and the latter took
several deep swallows of it, spitting indignantly as he
thrust it away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Darned stuff&ndash;&ndash;Martini cocktails. But&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson found himself laughing. Nothing Danbury
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
could have said would so prove the inconsequence of
his injuries. It relieved his strained nerves until,
in reaction, he became almost hysterical.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the joke?&#8221; demanded Danbury, rising to
a sitting posture and feeling at the cut in the back
of his head. &#8220;Where&#8217;s the lights? What has
happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A bit of a fight. Can you make your feet?&#8221;</p>
<p>Danbury groped for the side of the bunk, and with
the help of Wilson stood up. He was at first dizzy,
but he soon came to himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can walk, come on. I want to look for
Stubbs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson groped his way into the smoke-filled passageway
and across to the other cabin. They found Stubbs
lying on the floor unconscious. A superficial examination
revealed no serious wound and so, urged on by the
increasing noise above, they left him and hurried to
the deck. They found the second mate pushing the
stubborn group nearer and nearer their own quarters.
He was backed by only two men armed with knives
and clubs. The gang was hesitating, evidently tempted
to turn upon the tiny group, but with the appearance
of Wilson and Danbury they pressed at once for the
narrow opening.</p>
<p>At sight of them Danbury completely lost his head.
It was as though he then first realized what had
actually been attempted. He raised his weapon and
was upon the point of shooting into their midst when
Wilson knocked up his hand and sent the revolver
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
spinning across the deck. But Danbury scarcely
looked around to see who had foiled him. He rushed
headlong into the group as though he were the center
of a football team. He struck right and left with
his naked fists and finally by chance fell upon Splinter.
The two rolled upon the deck until the mate stooped
and picked up Splinter bodily and, raising him above
his head, fairly hurled him like a bag of grain down
the ladder after the last of the mutineers.</p>
<p>Danbury, in spite of his loss of blood, held himself
together wonderfully. For the next hour all were
busy, and between them placed Splinter in irons, and
crowded the mutineers, a cowed lot, into the forward
hold. They found Stubbs still unconscious, but he
came around after a good swig of brandy. He rose
to his elbow and blinked dazedly at Danbury.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mutiny,&#8221; answered Danbury, briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And me laid up, an&#8217; outer it. Jus&#8217; my pizen
luck,&#8221; he growled.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3><i>In the Shadow of the Andes</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">As</span> soon as lights were secured an examination
of the battle ground was made. Four men were
found, three of them with leg wounds which did no
more than cripple them, and one with a scalp wound
made by a grazing bullet which had knocked him unconscious.
There was no surgeon aboard, but one of
the mates had a good working knowledge of surgery
and cleaned and dressed the wounds.</p>
<p>As soon as it was daylight Stubbs had a talk with
the mutineers.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Course,&#8221; he informed them, &#8220;&#8217;course ye knows
the medicine ye gets fer mutiny on the high seas.
<a name="P164"></a>Every yeller dog of ye can look for&#8217;ard to a prison
sentence of twenty years or so. As for Splinter&ndash;&ndash;yer
leader&ndash;&ndash;I can &#8217;member the time I&#8217;d ha&#8217; had the
pleasure er watchin&#8217; him squirm from a yardarm without
any further preliminaries. As &#8217;tis, maybe he&#8217;ll
be &#8217;lowed to think it over th&#8217; rest of his life in a cell.&#8221;</p>
<p>He kept them on a diet of crackers and corned beef
and they never opened their lips in protest. Every
day they were brought up morning and afternoon for
drill. After this the three men divided the night into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
the three shifts so that at least one of them was always
upon guard. But the men were thoroughly cowed,
and evidently hoped, by good behavior, to re&euml;stablish
themselves before port was reached.</p>
<p>It was during these night watches that Wilson had
many long talks with Stubbs&ndash;&ndash;talks that finally became
personal and which in the end led him, by one
of those quick impulses which make in lives for a great
deal of good or wrecking harm, to confide in him the
secret of the treasure. This he did at first, however,
without locating it nearer than &#8220;Within five hundred
miles of where we&#8217;re going,&#8221; and with nothing in his
narrative to associate the idol with the priest. Truth
to tell, Wilson was disappointed at the cool way in
which Stubbs listened. But the latter explained his
indifference somewhat when he remarked, removing
the clay pipe from his mouth:</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217; boy, I&#8217;m sorter past my treasure hunting days.
Once&#8217;t I dug up &#8217;bout an acre of sand on one of the
islands of the South seas an&#8217; it sorter took all th&#8217; enthusiasm,
as ye might say, fer sech sport outern me.
We didn&#8217;t git nothin&#8217; but clam shells, as I remember.
Howsomever, I wouldn&#8217;t git nothin&#8217; but clam shells
outern a gold mine. Thet&#8217;s th&#8217; way m&#8217; luck runs.
Maybe th&#8217; stuff&#8217;s there, maybe it ain&#8217;t; but if I goes,
it ain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, a moment later:</p>
<p>&#8220;Howsomever, I can see how, in order to find the
girl, you has to go. The dago gent&ndash;&ndash;if he lives&ndash;&ndash;will
make fer that right off. I&#8217;ve heern o&#8217; women with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
the gift o&#8217; conjurin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;like seventh sons o&#8217; seventh
sons&ndash;&ndash;but I ain&#8217;t ever met with sech. I dunno now&ndash;&ndash;I
dunno now but what I might consider your proposition
if we comes outern this right and the cap&#8217;n here
can spare me. I can&#8217;t say this minute as how I takes
much stock in it, as ye might say. But I tell ye fair,
I&#8217;m glad to help a pardner and glad to have a try, fer
the sake of the girl if nothin&#8217; more. I don&#8217;t like ter
see an older man play no sech games as this man&ndash;&ndash;who
d&#8217; ye say his name is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorez.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we can find out more &#8217;bout him down here.
Anyhow, we&#8217;ll talk it over, boy, when we gits through
this. In the meanwhile yer secret is safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson felt better at the thought that there was now
someone with whom he could talk freely of the treasure.
It became the main topic of conversation during
the watch which he usually sat out with Stubbs, after
his own.</p>
<p>The ship&#8217;s log of the remainder of this long journey
would read as uninterestingly as that of an ocean liner.
Day succeeded day, and week followed week, with
nothing to disturb the quiet of the trip. A stop was
made at Rio for coal, another after rounding the Horn
(here they did not have the excitement of even high
seas), and another halfway up the West coast. But
at these places not a man was allowed to leave the ship,
Danbury, Wilson, and Stubbs themselves remaining
on board in fear of a possible attempt on the part of the
mercenaries to land.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>As a matter of fact, the latter were thoroughly
frightened and did their best by good behavior to offset
the effect of their attempt. They were obedient at
drills, respectful to all, and as quiet as the crew itself.
This was as Stubbs had anticipated, but he on his side
gave no sign of relenting in the slightest until the day
before they sighted Choco Bay, where the landing was
to be made. On the contrary, by dark hints and suggestions
he gave them to understand that certain of
them&ndash;&ndash;and no one knew who was included in this
generality&ndash;&ndash;stood actually in danger of prison sentences.
So they outdid one another in the hope of reinstating
themselves. At the conclusion of what was
to be their last drill Stubbs called them to attention and
sprung the trap to which he had been gradually leading
them. He studied them with a face heavy with clouds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are nearing our port,&#8221; he drawled, &#8220;an&#8217; some
of you are nearin&#8217; the jail. An&#8217; a jail in these diggin&#8217;s,
my beauties, is a thing that ain&#8217;t no joke, &#8217;cause they
shets you up below ground where ye has only your
natural frien&#8217;s the rats fer playmates,&ndash;&ndash;rats as big
as dogs an&#8217; hungry as sharks, as ye might say. Sometimes
the cap&#8217;n of these here ports fergits ye&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;specially
if they&#8217;s frien&#8217;s er mine. If they thinks of it,
they brings yer sour bread an&#8217; water an&#8217; yer fights the
rats fer it; if they fergits, as they has a way er doin&#8217;,
you jus&#8217; stay there until the rats gits stronger than
you. Then, little by little, yer goes. But they
buries yer bones very partic&#8217;lar, if they finds any.
They takes their time in this country, they takes their
time.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></div>
<p>Several of the men in the rear huddled closer to one
another. One or two in the front row wiped the
back of their hands over their brows.</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t take &#8217;Merican citizens,&#8221; growled someone.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they can&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;wuss luck for the &#8217;Merican citizens.
The others stand some show&ndash;&ndash;but &#8217;Merican
citizens don&#8217;t stand none. &#8217;Cause they shets yer up
without a hearin&#8217; and communicates with the consul.
The consul is drunk mostly an&#8217; devilesh hard to find
an&#8217; devilesh slow to move. But the rats ain&#8217;t,&ndash;&ndash;Lord,
no, the rats ain&#8217;t. They is wide awake an&#8217; waitin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>A big man in the rear shouldered his way to the
front.</p>
<p><a name="P168"></a>
&#8220;See here, Cap&#8217;n,&#8221; he blurted out, &#8220;I&#8217;ve had a talk
with some of the men, an&#8217; we don&#8217;t want none er
that. We&#8217;ve done wrong, maybe, but, Gawd, we don&#8217;t
want thet. Give us a show,&ndash;&ndash;give us a fightin&#8217; show.
We&#8217;ll go where you say and we&#8217;ll fight hard. We
weren&#8217;t used to this sorter thing an&#8217; so it comes a bit
tough. But give us a show an&#8217; we&#8217;ll prove what we
can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned to the band behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha&#8217; d&#8217; yer say, fellers? Is this on the level?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure! Sure! Sure!&#8221;</p>
<p>The cry came heartily.</p>
<p>Stubbs thought a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this here another little game?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;Once yer git on land are yer goin&#8217; ter turn yeller
agin?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No! No! No!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause it won&#8217;t do yer no good, anyhow. Now
I tell yer&ndash;&ndash;the cap&#8217;n an&#8217; I had a talk over this an&#8217;
I was fer lettin&#8217; yer take yer medicine an&#8217; pickin&#8217; up
another bunch. Men is cheap down here. But he
says, &#8216;No; if they&#8217;ll act like white men, give &#8217;em a
show. I want to git this princess with &#8217;Mericans an&#8217;
I want to show these fellers what &#8217;Mericans can do
behin&#8217; a rifle.&#8217; Our game is to git to Carlina and lick
the bunch of Guinnies thet has stolen the young lady&#8217;s
throne. If ye wanter do thet an&#8217; do it hard and square&ndash;&ndash;well,
he&#8217;s fer lettin&#8217; this other thing drop. Fight
an&#8217; yer gits cash &#8217;nuff to keep drunk fer a year; squeal
an&#8217; yer gits shot in the back without any more talk.
There&#8217;s a square offer&ndash;&ndash;do ye take it like men?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure! Give us a show!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then three cheers fer yer cap&#8217;n&ndash;&ndash;Cap&#8217;n
Danbury.&#8221;</p>
<p>This time the cheers were given with a will, and
the boat rang with the noise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then, lay low an&#8217; take yer orders. An&#8217; I
wish yer luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three cheers fer Cap&#8217;n Stubbs,&#8221; shouted someone.</p>
<p>And as Stubbs bashfully beat a hasty retreat, the
cheers rang lustily in his ears.</p>
<p>But he reported to Danbury with his face beaming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;ye&#8217;ve gut some men worth
something. They&#8217;ll be fightin&#8217; fer themselves&ndash;&ndash;fightin&#8217;
to keep outern jail. Mutiny has its uses.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next morning the anchor clanked through blue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
waters into golden sand and the throbbing engines
stopped.</p>
<p>The land about Choco Bay is a pleasant land. It
is surpassed only by the plains along the upper Orinoco
where villages cluster in the bosom of the Andes in a
season of never changing autumn. Nearer the coast
the climate is more fitful and more drowsy. One
wonders how history would have been changed had the
early Puritans chanced upon such rich soil for their
momentous conquering, instead of the rock-ribbed,
barren coast of New England. The same energy, the
same dauntless spirit, the same stubborn clinging to
where the foot first fell, if expended here, would have
gained for them and their progeny a country as near
the Garden of Eden as any on earth. But perhaps the
balmy breezes, the warming sun, the coaxing sensualism
of Nature herself would have wheedled them away
from their stern principles and turned them into a
nation of dreamers. If so, what dreamers we should
have had! We might have had a dozen more Keatses,
perhaps another Shakespeare. For this is a poet&#8217;s
land, where things are only half real. The birds sing
about Choco Bay.</p>
<p>Rippling through the blue waters after dark, the
yacht glided in as close to the shore as possible. The
morning sun revealed a golden semicircle of sand rimming
the turquoise waters of the bay. Across the blue
sky above seagulls skimmed and darted and circled;
so clear the waters beneath that the clean bottom showed
like a floor of burnished gold. The harbor proper lay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
ten miles beyond, where a smaller inlet with deeper
soundings was protected from the open inrush of the
sea by the promontory forming one tip of this broader
crescent. Far, very far in the distance the lofty Andes
raised their snowy crests&ndash;&ndash;monarchs which, Jove-like,
stood with their heads among the clouds. So they had
stood while kings were born, fought their petty fights,
died, and gave place to others; so they stood while
men contended for their different gods; so they stood
while men loved and followed their loves into other
spheres. It was these same summits upon which Wilson
now looked which had greeted Quesada, and these same
summits at which Quesada had shaken his palsied fist.
It was these same summits which but a short while
before must have greeted Jo; it was possible that at
their very base he might find her again, and with her
a treasure which should make her a queen before men.
It made them seem very intimate to him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3><i>Good News and Bad</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">Though</span> Wilson had listened with interest
enough to the plans of the present campaign
as outlined to him by Danbury, it must be confessed
that he was still a bit hazy about the details. He
understood that three interests were involved; those
of the Revolutionary party, who under General Otaballo
were inspired by purely patriotic motives in
their desire to see the present government overthrown;
those of Danbury, who was governed by more sentimental
considerations, and, finally, those of the
priest, who was prompted by revenge. General Otaballo
was the last of one of those old families of
Carlina who had spent their lives in the service of the
family of Montferaldo. His grandfather, to go back
no further, had died defending the last reigning queen,
his father had been shot for leading a conspiracy to
restore the family, and now the grandson was following
in the old way. He was an old man now and had
missed death a hundred times by narrow margins
owing to his connection with just such enterprises as
this. This was to be his last stand and into it he was
throwing his heart and soul and to his standard gathering
whatever forces he could win by hook or crook. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
was he who had heard of Danbury and it was he who
had prompted him to bargain with the priest. With
a record of past defeats he himself had lost prestige
with the hill people. And yet both the priest and
Danbury turned to him now to manage the campaign.
He knew the people, he knew every detail of the Republican
army, every particular of the forts and other
defenses, and every traitor in their ranks.</p>
<p>To take Carlina it was necessary only to capture
Bogova, its capital. This city of some 20,000 inhabitants
lay about the inner port and some eight miles
from the bay where Danbury&#8217;s yacht now rode at
anchor, safely, because of the treachery of the harbor
patrol, who to a man were with the Revolutionists.
Danbury had been instructed by Otaballo, through the
priest, to make this harbor and remain until receiving
further instructions. The latter came within
three hours in the form of two letters; one from the
General, and the other, enclosed, from the princess
herself. Danbury tore open the letter before glancing
at the official communication. He read it through and
then stood with it in his hand looking dreamily out
across the blue waters. He whistled to himself. Then
handing it to Wilson, he asked,</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson read,</p>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Dear Dick:</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>I hope you have thought over what I
said to you and haven&#8217;t planned to do anything foolish.
Because, honestly, it can&#8217;t do any good. The old people are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
gone and with them the old cause. But I have heard rumors
on all sides until I am nearly frightened to death about what
you may have stirred up. When General Otaballo stole in
this morning and showed me beneath his coat that old uniform
I knew something serious was meant.</p>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>And, Dicky, I don&#8217;t want to be a queen&ndash;&ndash;even to get revenge
upon the cads who haven&#8217;t been nice. I don&#8217;t want to
rule; it&#8217;s more bother than it&#8217;s worth; I&#8217;m afraid the royal
blood has got pretty well thinned out in me, for I don&#8217;t feel
any thrill stirring within at the war-cry,&ndash;&ndash;only trembles.
I want to jog along the same old peaceful path and I want
you to come and see me like the dear good friend you&#8217;ve
always been. And if you&#8217;ve got your pockets full of pistols,
and your hands full of swords, throw them away, Dicky,
and just jump into a carriage and come up and have supper
with me. I&#8217;ve really been lonesome for you,&ndash;&ndash;more, to be
honest, than I thought I&#8217;d be or than I like to be. It&#8217;s the
woman and not the queen who has been lonesome, too. So
be a good boy and don&#8217;t get either of us into trouble, but
bring the general to tea with you. We can fight it all out
just as well over the cakes and no one the wiser.</p>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:2.0em; text-align:right'><span style='margin-right: 3.0em;'>Yours,</span><br />
<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Beatrice.</span>&#8221;<br /></p>
<p>Wilson smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that it might be pleasant
to&ndash;&ndash;take supper with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danbury spoke earnestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But a man can&#8217;t sit and eat cakes while such as
she is insulted on her own streets. A man can&#8217;t drink
tea with her&ndash;&ndash;he must be up and doing for her. I
shall take supper with her when she is a queen in her
own kingdom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t seem to want to be queen.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But she shall,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;by the grace of
God, she shall, within two days!&#8221;</p>
<p>He tore open the missive from General Otaballo,
and read aloud the instructions. But not until the
last paragraph did Wilson learn anything of moment.
Then, in a second his whole attitude towards the
campaign was changed.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition to your present interest in this movement,
I have news that ought to spur your men on to
added effort; the dogs of Republicans have arrested
and imprisoned an American young lady, who reached
here on the Columba in company with Dr. Sorez.
The latter, though formerly a loyal Republican, has
for some reason been thought in league with us, though,
as far as I know, he is not. But the girl is the victim
of the arbitrary and unjust persecution which has
always been meted out to foreigners.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson was left dumb for a moment. But his mind
soon grasped the urgency of the situation. He placed
his hand upon Danbury&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Danbury,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get to
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say that this is&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The same one. Evidently Sorez has got her into
trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But this is serious&ndash;&ndash;this imprisonment. The
dungeons aren&#8217;t fit for a dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; answered Wilson; &#8220;but we&#8217;ll get her out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t, until we batter down the old prison.
<i>They</i> won&#8217;t let her out&ndash;&ndash;not for us.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But why should they shut her up? What possible
excuse can they have? It&#8217;s outrageous. If we can
reach the authorities&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be locked up too. The authorities would
be glad to have you come within reach. No, their
suspicions are aroused, and to make a move towards
her release would be only to excite them to do worse.
You&#8217;ll have to wait&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s impossible. Wait, with her in the hands
of those ruffians!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait until we get the ruffians in our hands.
Otaballo plans the attack for early to-morrow; we
ought to be in the city by noon. Once the place is
ours you can take a force of men and go through the
jail; I imagine that it is in the old palace. That
is where I was locked up overnight, at any rate; and
if it is like that&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson glanced up swiftly, his face pale.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was bad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was worse than that. But maybe they have a
better place for the women.&#8221;</p>
<p>The remainder of the day was a nightmare to Wilson.
He paced the decks until in weariness he dropped
into his bunk. Both Danbury and Stubbs kept a watch
upon him for fear that he might attempt to go ashore
on some wild project for reaching the city. He
scarcely slept an hour that night and went with the
first boat load to leave the ship.</p>
<p>A full moon lighted the beach like a colorless sun.
He stood with the silent group handling their Winchesters.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
There was not one of them, even though
he peered somewhat anxiously into the deep shadows
by the roadside, who did not feel more of a man now
that he was on shore; this, even with the prospect of
danger ahead. They were essentially landsmen&ndash;&ndash;a
thing which Stubbs had not understood. They looked
upon the ship only as a prison. Now, with their feet
on firm ground, they were a different lot of men. Few
of them were actual cowards, and still fewer of them
objected to the prospective fight, even though they had
been drawn into it in what they considered an underhanded
way. But the real reason for their good humor
lay deeper, so deep that not one man had dared as yet
whisper it to another, although each knew the other
to be of the same mind. This was the prospect of loot.
Whichever side won, there would be a fine confusion in
a lawless city, with opportunities galore for plunder.</p>
<p>Most of them had vague notions that these South
American cities were fabulously rich in gold. Consequently,
if they could not be depended upon afterwards,
they could be trusted to do their best to make
the city, and to fight so long as their own security was
in jeopardy. To rebel before they got there would
only place them between two fires, and they feared
Stubbs too well to attempt it even if there was a
chance. So, take them all in all as they stood there
upon dry land, they were about as fair a fighting lot
as mercenaries ever average.</p>
<p>The last thing to be brought from the boat was the
ammunition, and this was not distributed until the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
only method left of reaching the ship was by swimming.
Wilson sat upon the boxes with a revolver in
each hand until the last boat left the shore. Then
Stubbs broke open the boxes and made his final speech
to the men who in a way he was now placing without
his authority.</p>
<p>&#8220;Afore I gives you these,&#8221; he began, &#8220;I wants to
remind yer of the little talk we had t&#8217; other night.
Each man of yer gits fifty cartridges and with them
either he makes Bogova er Hell. There ain&#8217;t no other
stoppin&#8217; places. Ye may have thought, some of ye,
that once yer rifles was loaded ye could do &#8217;bout as ye
pleased. But t&#8217;ain&#8217;t so. Jus&#8217; behin&#8217; you there&#8217;ll
march one hundred men from the hills. They don&#8217;t
know much, but they obey orders, an&#8217; their orders is
to shoot anybody what ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; our way. Ye&#8217;ve
got a chance, marchin&#8217; straight on an&#8217; takin&#8217; the city;
ye ain&#8217;t gut the ghost of a chance, if ye don&#8217;t take the
city er if ye fergits the way and starts back towards
the ship. &#8217;Nother thing; hold tergether. It ain&#8217;t
pleasant fer a man caught by hisself in Bogova.
Thet&#8217;s all, gents, an&#8217; I hopes it will be my pleasant
duty to hand ye soon a five-dollar gold piece fer everyone
of these here things I now hands ye.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson suppressed a shout, and soon there was the
confused clicking of the locks as they closed over the
full chambers of the rifles. It was music to the ears
of Danbury, who from the moment his feet had
touched shore was impatient to take the road without
further delay. Wilson was just as bad, if not worse,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
which left Stubbs really the only man of them all
able to think calmly and somewhat rationally.</p>
<p>He formed the men into columns of two, hastily inspected
each one of them, and finally got them started
with Danbury and the guide leading, Wilson, on the
right side, and himself on the left and well to the rear
where he could watch for possible desertions until the
hill men took their place behind them. It was a new
world for them all; the strange tropical foliage silhouetted
against the vivid night sky, the piercing
perfume of new flowers, and the shadow jungle either
side made it seem almost unreal. At the junction of
this forest path and the main road the hill men fell
in behind like ghosts. They were brown, medium-sized
men, dressed in cotton trousers and blouses. They
were without shoes or hats and were armed with a
medley of weapons, from modern rifles to the big,
two-edged sword with which their ancestors fought.
Save under the leadership of the priest, they were
said not to be good fighters, but with him to spur them
on they became veritable demons, hurling themselves
upon the enemy with a recklessness only possible to
religious fanatics. So fiercely had they resisted the
attack made upon them in the expedition of the hills
that it was said that not within ten years would it be
possible to organize again sufficient men with courage
to venture to cross the Andes.</p>
<p>The road turned and twisted, wandered up hill and
down, beckoning them on through this phantasmal
world which but for them would have slept on in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
aromatic peace. To Wilson this all seemed part of
a dream. It was one of those strange visions he had
seen between the stars that night after the crash when
he had gazed from his study window. Somehow it
did not seem to belong in his life at all. The girl did,
but nothing else did. It was meant for him to have
her, but in the usual ruts of men.</p>
<p>This was some other self which, with holsters and
cartridge belt, was marching in the dark with this
group of uncouth men. The only thing that made it
real was the fact that he was moving towards her.
Once he had found her he would go back again and
seek his place in the vast machine which weaved cloths
of more sober fabric. Then he thought of the map
which he had taken from the chest and put into his
pocket. That, too, was a part of this dream. It was
fitting that in such an atmosphere as this there should
be hidden gold and jewels; fitting, too, that this new
self of his should be in search of them. But if only
he could reach her, if only he could have her fairly
within his arms, he would give this up to others who
had more need of it. She had said that if ever she
were in need of him, she would call and he would come
to her. That seemed like an idle phrase at the time,
and yet it had come true. She had called and he was
now on his way to give her aid. He could not imagine
her in the dungeon.</p>
<p>At the end of two hours, a rifle shot spat through the
dark branches by the roadside. Then silence&ndash;&ndash;a
silence so unbroken that it seemed in a minute as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
though the noise had never been. Then Otaballo rode
up at a gallop and gave a few orders. His men, who
led the forces, divided silently and disappeared each
side of the road into the dark timber. Then for another
half hour the remainder of the men marched
on as before. The sky began to brighten in the east.
A grayish pink stole from the horizon line and grew
ever brighter and brighter as though a breeze were
blowing into the embers of an ash-covered fire. The
pink grew to crimson and with it the shadows sought
their deeper haunts. As the first real beams of the
sun shot above the distant hills the angular jumble of
distant roof-tops became silhouetted against the clear,
blue sky.</p>
<p>A messenger came galloping down the road with
orders for Danbury.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are to enter by the East Road. Follow your
guide.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sputtering report of distant rifles came to their
ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, see here,&#8221; protested Danbury, &#8220;the fighting
is straight ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take your orders,&#8221; advised Wilson. &#8220;There will
be enough of that to go around, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rattle directly ahead acted like wine upon
Danbury. Wilson heard him shout.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, men. Let&#8217;s take it at double-quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the men could not stand the pace he cut out
and so he was forced to fall back to stubborn marching.
Their path swung to the right, and past many straggling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
houses where the good housewives were just up
and kindling their fires, with no inkling of what was
about. To them nothing was ahead but the meagre
routine of another day. Occasionally they caught a
glimpse of the passing men and returned, startled, to
drag out their sleepy spouses and all the children.
The sun had warmed the whole of this little world now
and trees and houses stood out clean and distinct as
though freshly washed. To the left the dry crackle
of the rifles still sounded. It was evident that Otaballo
had met with a good-sized force and one evidently
prepared. It was not long before the road took them
into the city proper. Before they had reached the
first paved street Danbury turned to his men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, come on at a jump. There is a five-hundred-dollar
bonus to the first man in the palace.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew a revolver from his holster and, spurring
on the guide, encouraged the men to a double-quick.
Wilson kept by his side. They ran through the silent
streets like phantom ghouls in a deserted city. Every
window was tight shut and every door double-barred.
The rumor had spread fast and entered the city an
hour before them. They made a great rattling as they
ran heavily down the narrow alleys and through the
silent squares, but they received no more attention
than a party of merry-makers returning in the small
hours from some country dance. Then they rounded
a corner and&ndash;&ndash;a blinding flash from a red line of
rifles checked their brisk progress. Wilson staggered
back a few steps with his hand over his eyes like a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
man hit beneath the chin. The noise was deafening.
Then he turned slowly in a daze and looked to see
what the men were doing. A half dozen of them had
lain down as though to sleep, sprawled out in curiously
uncomfortable attitudes. The others had paused a
moment as if in doubt.</p>
<p>Their frightened eyes brought him to himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; he growled. &#8220;Shoot low and fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>A group of the real fighters swept past to the
accompaniment of biting snaps like the explosion of
firecrackers. Then he fought his way to the front
again, elbowing men to one side.</p>
<p>The thing that seemed remarkable to him was that
he could face that spitting red line of rifles and yet
keep his feet. They must be poor shots, he thought.
He himself began to shoot rather deliberately. He
did not see the faces of the men at whom he shot,
for he always aimed at their breasts. Once, however,
he took careful aim at a white face which lay against
the breech of a rifle leveled at him. He aimed for the
white space between the eyes quite as coolly as though
he were facing a target. Yet he jumped a little in
surprise as, following his report, he saw a blotch of
red appear where he had aimed&ndash;&ndash;saw it for just a
second before the man reeled forward heavily and
sunk as though he had no backbone.</p>
<p>The powder smoke choked him, but he loved it. He
liked the smell of it and the taste of it, because it led
to her. He lost all sense of personalities. The forms
before him were not men. He forgot all about his comrades;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
forgot even what it was all about, except that
he was hewing a path to her. It was just a noisy medley
in which he had but one part to play,&ndash;&ndash;shoot and press
on to the dungeon which confined her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3><i>The Priest Takes a Hand</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">How</span> long this continued&ndash;&ndash;this pressing forward,
following the spitting fire of his hot
rifle&ndash;&ndash;Wilson could not tell. From the first he could
make nothing out of the choking confusion of it all,
finding his satisfaction, his motive, his inspiration
in the realization that he was adding the might of his
being to the force which was pounding the men who
had dared to touch this girl. He was drunk with this
idea. He fought blindly and with the spirit of his
ancestors which ought long since to have been trained
out of him. So foot by foot he fought his way on
and knew it not when brought to a standstill. Only
when he found himself being pressed back with the
mass did he realize that something had happened;
re&euml;nforcements had arrived to the enemy. But this
meant only that they must fight the harder. Turning,
he urged the men to stand fast. They obeyed for a
moment, but the increased force was too many for
them; they were steadily beaten back. For a second
it looked as though they were doomed to annihilation,
for once they were scattered among those narrow streets
they would be shot down like dogs. At this point
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
Wilson became conscious of the presence of a gaunt
figure, dressed in a long, black robe, bearing upon
back and chest in gold embroidery the figure of a
blazing sun.</p>
<p>He stood in front of the men a second gazing up
at the sky. Even the enemy paused to watch him.
Then turning to the hill men who had wavered in
the rear, he merely pointed his outstretched arm
towards the enemy. The effect was instantaneous;
they swept past the mercenaries, swept past Wilson,
<a name="P186"></a>yelling and screaming like a horde of maniacs. They
waved queer knives and spears, brandished rifles, and
then, bending low, charged the frightened line of rifles
before them. Wilson paused to look at this strange
figure. He recognized him instantly as the priest of
whom he had heard so much and who had played in
his own life of late so important a part. The man was
standing stock still, smiling slightly. Then with some
dignity he moved away never even looking back, as
confident of the result as though he were an instrument
of Fate. If he had seen the man he had struck
down in the house of Sorez, he gave no evidence of it.
And once again Wilson found himself moving on
steadily towards the old palace.</p>
<p>The men from the hills swept everything from before
them; the superstitious enemy being driven as much
by their fear as by the force of the attack. Behind
them came the mercenaries to the very gates of the
palace. Here they were checked by a large oaken door.
From the windows either side of this puffs of smoke,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
fire-pierced, darted viciously. The men behind Wilson
answered, but their bullets only flattened against the
granite surface of the structure. He realized that this
was to be the centre of the struggle. They must carry
this at any cost. He heard oaths in the rear and turned
to see Stubbs whipping on three men who were dragging
the small Gatling gun brought from the ship.
It looked like a toy. As Stubbs stooped to adjust it,
Wilson saw one of the men dart from the line and disappear
into the open doorway of a house to the right.
Stubbs saw it, too, and now, suddenly turning, put two
shots at the fellow&#8217;s heels. Then he turned to the gun,
with a warning to the others. But he never finished
it. He sank to the street. Danbury rushed up from
somewhere and bent over him, but Stubbs was already
getting to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damned thing only glanced,&#8221; he growled, putting
his hand to his head, &#8220;but&ndash;&ndash;it came from behind!&#8221;</p>
<p>As he faced the men for a second, one man slunk
back into the rear. Wilson raised his revolver, but
Stubbs pushed it to one side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Later,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The gun was wheeled into place and it became the
center for all the firing from the palace. In a few
seconds it was pouring a steady stream of lead into
the oaken door and splintering the lock into a hundred
pieces. With a howl the men saw the barrier fall and
pressed on. Danbury led them, but halfway he fell.
Forty men swarmed over him.</p>
<p>Once within the palace walls, Wilson and Stubbs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
found their hands full. They realized as they charged
through the outer guardroom and down the dark, oak-furnished
hall that this gang at their heels would be
difficult to control within the intricate mazes of this
old building. But their attention was soon taken from
this by a volley from the antechamber to the right
which opened into the old throne room. The men
rallied well and followed at their heels as they pressed
through the door. They found here some twenty men.
Wilson had emptied his revolver and found no time
in which to reload.</p>
<p>He hurled himself upon the first man he saw and
the two fell to the floor where they tumbled about like
small boys in a street fight. They kicked and squirmed
and reached for each other&#8217;s throats until they rolled
into the anteroom where they were left alone to fight
it out. Wilson made his feet and the other followed
as nimbly as a cat. Then the two faced each other.
The humor of the situation steadied Wilson for a
moment. Shot after shot was ringing through the
old building, men fighting for their lives with modern
rifles, and yet here he stood driven back to a savage,
elemental contest with bare fists in a room built a century
before. It was almost as though he had suddenly
been thrust out of the present into the past. But the
struggle was none the less serious.</p>
<p>His opponent rushed and Wilson met him with a
blow which landed between the eyes. It staggered
him. Wilson closed with him, but he felt a pair of
strong arms tightening about the small of his back.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
In spite of all he could do, he felt himself break.
He fell. The fellow had his throat in a second. He
twisted and squirmed but to no purpose. He tried a
dozen old wrestling tricks, but the fingers only tightened
the firmer. Cheek against cheek the two lay
and the fingers with fierce zeal sank deeper and deeper
into Wilson&#8217;s throat. He strained his breast in the
attempt to catch a single breath. He saw the stuccoed
ceiling above him slowly blur and fade. The
man&#8217;s weight pressed with cruel insistence until it
seemed as though he were supporting the whole building.
He heard his deep gulping breathing, felt his
hot breath against his neck.</p>
<p>The situation grew maddening because of his helplessness,
then terrifying. Was he going to die here
in an anteroom at the hands of this common soldier?
Was he going to be strangled like a clerk
at the hands of a footpad? Was the end coming
here, within perhaps a hundred yards of Jo? He
threw every ounce in him into a final effort to
throw off this demon. The fellow, with legs wide
apart, remained immovable save spasmodically to take
a tighter grip.</p>
<p>The sounds were growing far away. Then he
heard his name called and knew that Stubbs was
looking for him. This gave him a new lease of
life. It was almost as good as a long breath. But
he couldn&#8217;t answer&ndash;&ndash;could make no sound to indicate
where he was. The call came again from almost
beside the door. Then he saw Stubbs glance in among
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
the shadows and move off again. He kicked weakly
at the floor. Then he heaved his shoulders with a
strength new-born in him, and the fellow&#8217;s tired fingers
weakened,&ndash;&ndash;weakened for so long as he could
take one full breath. But before he could utter the
shout the merciless fingers had found their grip once
more. The man on top of him, now half crazed,
snapped at his ear like a dog. Then he pressed one
knee into the pit of Wilson&#8217;s stomach with gruelling
pain. He was becoming desperate with the resistance
of this thing beneath him.</p>
<p>Once again Stubbs appeared at the door. Wilson
raised his leg and brought it down sharply. Stubbs
jumped at the sound and looked in more closely. He
saw the two forms. Then he bent swiftly and brought
the butt of his revolver down sharply on the fellow&#8217;s
temple. What had been a man suddenly became nothing
but a limp bundle of bones. Wilson threw him
off without the slightest effort. Then he rolled over
and devoted himself to the business of drinking in
air&ndash;&ndash;great gulps of it, choking over it as a famished
man will food.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you hurt anywhere?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can ye stand up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty nigh the rocks that time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&ndash;&ndash;had a grip like iron.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better keep out in the open sea where ye can be
seen.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></div>
<p>Wilson struggled up and, except for a biting pain
in his throat, soon felt himself again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Danbury?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno. But we can&#8217;t stop to look for him. That
gang has gone wild. Guess we&#8217;ve pretty nigh cleaned
out the place an&#8217; now they are runnin&#8217; free.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t Otaballo reach here soon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t tell. If he doesn&#8217;t he won&#8217;t find much left but
the walls. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; arter them an&#8217; see what I can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better keep your eyes open. They&#8217;ll shoot you
in a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe so, mebbe not.&#8221;</p>
<p>He led the way along an intricate series of corridors
to a broad flight of stairs. Above there was a noise
like a riot.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can git &#8217;em inter one room&ndash;&ndash;a room with a
lock on &#8217;t,&#8221; he growled.</p>
<p>As they hurried along, Wilson caught glimpses of
massive furniture, gilded mirrors, costly damask hangings
brought over three hundred years before when
this was the most extravagant country on the face of
the earth. They took the broad stairs two at a time,
and had almost reached the top when Wilson stopped
as though he had been seized by the shoulder. For,
as distinctly as he had heard Stubbs a moment ago,
he heard Jo call his name. He listened intently for
a repetition. From the rooms beyond he heard the
scurrying of heavy feet, hoarse shouting, and the
tumble of overturned furniture. That was all. And
yet that other call still rang in his ears and echoed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
through his brain. Furthermore, it had been distinct
enough to give him a sense of direction; it came from
below. He hesitated only a second at thought of
leaving Stubbs, but this other summons was too imperative
to be neglected even for him. He turned and
leaped down the stairs to the lower floor.</p>
<p>In some way he must find the prison and in some
other way get the keys and go through those cells.
If he could find some member of the palace force, this
would be simple. He wandered from one room to
another but stumbled only over dead men. The
wounded had crawled out of sight and the others had
fled. A medley of rooms opened from the long halls
and Wilson ran from one of these to another. Finally,
in one he caught a glimpse of a skulking figure, some
underling, who had evidently returned to steal. In
a second he was after him. The chase led through
a half dozen chambers, but he kept at the fellow&#8217;s heels
like a hound after a fox. He cornered him at the end
of a passageway and pinned him against the wall.</p>
<p>In the little Spanish he had picked up Wilson
managed to make the fellow understand that he wished
to find his way to the prison. But the effect of this
was disastrous, for the man crumbled in his hands,
sinking weak-kneed to the floor where he began to beg
for mercy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not for you. I have friends there I wish to
free.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the love of God, go not near them. It is
death down there.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Up,&#8221; cried Wilson, snatching him to his feet.
&#8220;Lead the way or I shoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>He placed the cold muzzle of his revolver against
the nape of the fellow&#8217;s neck and drew a shriek from
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No! No! Do not shoot! But do not go there!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not another word. On, quickly!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know where,&ndash;&ndash;I swear I do not know,
signor!&#8221;</p>
<p>But hearing the sharp click of the weapon as
Wilson cocked it, he led the way. They passed the
length of several corridors which brought them to an
open courtyard on the further side of which lay a low,
granite building connected with the palace proper by
a series of other small buildings. The fellow pointed
to an open door.</p>
<p>&#8220;In there, signor. In there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the signor is not going to take me in there?
I pray,&ndash;&ndash;see, I pray on my knees not.&#8221;</p>
<p>He slumped again like a whipped dog and Wilson in
disgust and not then understanding his fear, kicked
him to his feet. The fellow trembled like one with
the ague; his cheeks were ashen, his eyes wide and
startled. One would have thought he was on his way
to his execution. Half pushed by Wilson, he entered
the door to what was evidently an outer guardroom, for
it contained only a few rough benches, an overturned
table which in falling had scattered about a pack of
greasy cards and a package of tobacco. Out of this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
opened another door set in solid masonry, and this,
too, stood ajar as though all the guards had suddenly
deserted their posts, as doubtless they had at the first
sound of firing. Still forcing his guide ahead, they
went through this door into a smaller room and here
Wilson made a thorough search for keys, but without
result. It was, of course, possible that below he might
still find a sentry or turnkey; but even if he did not,
he ought at least to be able to determine definitely
whether or not she were here. Then he would return
with men enough to tear the walls down if necessary.</p>
<p>They passed through an oak and iron door out of
this room and down a flight of stone steps which took
them into the first of the damp under-passageways
leading directly to the dungeons themselves. The air
was heavy with moisture and foul odors. It seemed
more like a vault for the dead than a house of the
living. Wilson had found and lighted a lantern and
this threw the feeblest of rays ahead. Before him his
prisoner fumbled along close to the wall, glancing
back at every step to make sure his captor was at his
heels.</p>
<p>So they came to a second corridor running in both
directions at right angles from that in which they stood.
He remained very still for a moment in the hope that
he might once more hear the voice which would give
him some hint of which way to turn. But the only
sound that greeted him was the scratch of tiny feet as
a big rat scurried by. He closed his eyes and concentrated
his thought upon her. He had heard that so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
people had communicated with one another and he himself
had had proof enough, if it were true that she was
here. But he found it impossible to concentrate his
thoughts in this place,&ndash;&ndash;even to keep his eyes closed.</p>
<p>Then the silence was pierced by a shriek, the sweat-starting,
nerve-racked cry of a man in awful pain.
It was not an appeal for mercy, or a cry for assistance,
but just a naked yell wrung from a throat grown big-veined
in the agony of torture. Wilson could think
of only one thing, the rats. He had a vision of them
springing at some poor devil&#8217;s throat after he had become
too weak to fight them off. The horrible damp
air muffled the cry instantly. He heard an oath from
his guide and the next second the fellow flew past him
like a madman and vanished from sight toward the
outer door. For a second Wilson was tempted to
follow. The thought of Jo turned him instantly.
He leaped to the left from where the cry had come,
holding the lantern above his head. His feet slipped
on the slimy ooze covering the clay floors, but by
following close to the wall he managed to keep his
feet. So he came to an open door. Within, he saw
dimly two figures, one apparently bending over the
other which lay prostrate. Pushing in, he thrust the
lantern closer to them. He had one awful glimpse of
a passion-distorted face; it was the Priest! It sent
a chill the length of him. He dropped the lantern
and shot blindly at the form which hurled itself upon
him with the flash of a knife.</p>
<p>Wilson felt a slight sting upon his shoulder; the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
Priest&#8217;s knife had missed him by the thickness of his
shirt. He closed upon the skinny form and reached
for his throat. The struggle was brief; the other was
as a child before his own young strength. The two
fell to the floor, but Wilson got to his feet in an instant
and picking up the other bodily hurled him against the
wall. For a second he tasted revenge, tingled with
the satisfaction of returning that blow in the dark.
The priest dropped back like a stunned rat.</p>
<p>The light in the overturned lantern was still flickering.
Snatching it up he thrust it before the eyes of
the man who now lay groaning in the aftermath of
the agony to which he had been subjected. The lantern
almost dropped from his trembling fingers as he recognized
in the face distorted with pain, Don Sorez. In
a flash he realized that the Priest had another and
stronger reason for joining this expedition than mere
revenge for his people; doubtless by a wile of some
sort he had caused the arrest of these two, and then
had led the attack upon the prison for the sake of
getting this man as completely within his power as
he had thought him now to be. The torture was for
the purpose of forcing the secret of the hiding place
of the image. For a second Wilson felt almost pity
for the man who lay stretched out before him; he
must have suffered terribly. But he wasted little
thought upon this; the girl was still to be located.
Wilson saw his eyes open. He stooped:</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you hear?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Is the girl in this
place?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></div>
<p>The thin lips moved, but there was no distinct response.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make an effort. Tell me, and I will get you out
of here too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lips fluttered as though Sorez was spurred by
this promise to a supreme effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;The key&ndash;&ndash;he has it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson followed the eyes and saw the brass thing
lying near the Priest.</p>
<p>He turned again to Sorez&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you tell me anything about where she is?
Is she near you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was nothing for it but to open each door in
order. It was of course likely that the two had been
thrust into nearby cells, but had these been filled she
might have been carried to the very end of the passageway.
He fitted the ponderous brass thing into the
first lock. It took a man&#8217;s strength to turn the rusty
and clumsy bolt, but it finally yielded. Again it
took a man&#8217;s strength to throw open the door upon
its rusted hinges. A half savage thing staggered to
the threshold and faced him with strange jabbering.
Its face and hands were cruelly lacerated, its eyes
bulging, its tattered remnants of clothes foul. Wilson
faced it a second and then stepped back to let it wander
aimlessly on down the corridors.</p>
<p>The cold sweat started from his brow. Supposing
Jo had gone mad? If the dark, the slime, the rats,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
could do this to a man, what would they not do to a
woman? He knew her; she would fight bravely and
long. There would be no whimpering, no hysterics,
but even so there would be a point where her woman&#8217;s
strength would fail. And all the while she might be
calling for him and wondering why he did not come.
But he <i>was</i> coming,&ndash;&ndash;he <i>was</i>! He forced the key
into the next door and turned another creaking lock.
And once again as the door opened he saw that a thing
not more than half human lay within. Only this time
it crouched in a far corner laughing horribly to itself.
It glared at him like some animal. He couldn&#8217;t let
such a thing as that out; it would haunt him the rest
of his life. It was better that it should laugh on so
until it died. He closed the door, throwing against
it all his strength with sudden horror. God, he might
go mad himself before he found her!</p>
<p>At the end of a dozen cells and a dozen such sights,
he worked in a frenzy. The prison now rang to the
shrieking and the laughter of those who wandered free,
and those who, still half sane, but savage, fought with
their fellows, too weak to do harm. The farther he
went the more hopeless seemed the task and the more
fiercely he worked. He began to sicken from the odors
and the dampness. Finally the bit of metal stuck in
one of the locks so fast that he could not remove it.
He twisted it to the right and to the left until his
numbed fingers were upon the point of breaking. In
a panic of fear he twisted his handkerchief in the
handle and throwing all his weight upon it tried to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
force it out. Then he inserted the muzzle of his
revolver in the key handle and using this for a lever
tried to turn it either way. It was in vain; it held
as firmly as though it had been welded into the lock. In
a rage he pounded and kicked at the door. Then he
checked himself.</p>
<p>If ever he hoped to finish his task, he must work
slowly and calmly. With his back to the door, he
rested for so long a time as a man might count five
hundred. He breathed slowly and deeply with his
eyes closed. Then he turned and began slowly to
work the key back and forth, in and out. It fell from
the lock. He reinserted it and after a few light manipulations,
turned it carefully to the right. The bolt
snapped back. He opened the door.</p>
<p>Within, all was dark. The cell seemed empty. In
fact, he was about to close the door and pass on to the
next cell, when he detected a slight movement in the
corner. He entered cautiously and threw his light
in that direction. Something&ndash;&ndash;a woman&ndash;&ndash;sat bolt
upright watching him as one might watch a vision.
He moved straight forward and when within two feet
paused, his heart leaping to his throat, his hand grown
so weak that he dropped the lantern.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jo!&#8221; he gasped tremblingly, still doubting his
own senses.</p>
<p>&#8220;David. You&ndash;&ndash;you came!&#8221;</p>
<p>He moved forward, arms outstretched, half fearing
she would vanish.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3><i>&#8217;Twixt Cup and Lip</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">He</span> took her in his arms and she lay there very
quietly, her head upon his shoulder, in the
lethargy of exhaustion. She clasped her hands about
his neck as a very tired child would do. The curve of
her cheek lay near his lips and, though he yearned to
do so, he would not kiss it. He did not speak to her,
but was satisfied to hold her there in silence. The feel
of her heart beating against his, the warmth of her
breath as it brushed his bare throat, the perfume of
her hair&ndash;&ndash;those things were enough now. After the
last long weeks of doubt, after the last day of gruelling
fear, after the terror of the last half hour, such things
as these were soul-satisfying. So he allowed himself
to stand a few minutes there in this dark cell which
to him had become suddenly fairer than any garden.
Then he spoke softly to her:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we will go out into the sunshine
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>She raised her head, looking at him through half-closed
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t want to move, David.&#8221;</p>
<p>He unclasped the hands from about his neck and,
placing an arm about her waist, led her slowly out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
into the corridor. She followed his guidance, resting
her weight upon him. And he who had come into this
foul place in terror and despair walked out in a dizzy
bewilderment of joy. As he passed the open door of
Sorez&#8217; cell he hesitated. The evil prompting of his
heart was to pass by this man&ndash;&ndash;so to let him go forever
out of his life. He had but to move on. He
could find a refuge for the girl where she would be
safe from this influence, but this would not be possible
if he stopped to take Sorez with them. Once the girl
knew the man was alive and in this condition her
sympathies would be so aroused that she would never
desert him. Wilson knew that he must decide instantly.
To leave that prison without him was to
leave him to his death. He turned towards the cell
door; he had promised.</p>
<p>The man had evidently recovered his strength somewhat,
for he sat upon the edge of the wooden bunk
staring about him. He was alone in the cell&ndash;&ndash;the
Priest was gone! On the whole, Wilson was glad of
this. He felt the better for not having the burden of
his death, however richly it was deserved, upon his
hands. The girl apparently was still in too much of
a daze to recognize Sorez. Wilson spoke to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you walk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Who are you? You speak
English!&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson repeated his question impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can walk, follow me and I&#8217;ll take you out
of this hole.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></div>
<p>The man tottered to his feet, groping with his hand
along the wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; said Wilson, overcoming a shrinking repugnance
he now felt for the man, &#8220;take my arm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorez grabbed it and with this much help was able
to get along. And so, with the girl he loved upon one
arm and the man he hated upon the other, Wilson made
his way along the slippery subterranean galleries. He
was practically carrying them both, but the lightness
of the one almost made up for the burden of the other.
The only thing for which he prayed was that none of
those whimpering things he had loosed from their
cells should cross his path. This was granted; for all
he saw or heard he might have been treading the
catacombs.</p>
<p>When he came again into the sunlight he was
blinded for a second, while the other two clapped their
hands over their eyes, suffering for quite a few moments
intense pain. Except for being a bit pale, the
girl did not look badly. Her hair had become loosened
and her gown begrimed, but Wilson still saw
her as she was that night when she lay curled up
asleep in the big chair. As for Sorez, whether it was
the pain of the torture or what, his hair, which before
was an iron gray, had turned almost white.</p>
<p>The three made their way across the courtyard and
again into the palace. He heard noise and confusion
on the floors above. The halls were rank with the smell
of powder. As they went on they found the floor
covered with splinters, and on either side saw the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
panels rent and torn as though by a huge iron claw.
There was still hoarse shouting and the occasional snap
of a pistol above, which showed that Stubbs had not
yet succeeded in controlling the men.</p>
<p>He had no idea as to where it was possible to take
the girl and Sorez, but he hoped that he might come
upon a room in the palace here where it would be safe
to leave them until it was possible to get out into the
city. Perhaps, too, if he reached the entrance, he
might find Stubbs. Sorez was beginning to weigh
heavily upon his arm, and he resented having to sacrifice
to him any of the strength he needed for the girl.
So he staggered on to the very room where a short
while before he had fought for his life. But here he
was checked by a noise from without&ndash;&ndash;cheering as
from the advance of several hundred men. Was it
possible that re&euml;nforcements had arrived for the government?
If so, this meant immediate danger. They
would exact vengeance swiftly and surely upon any
man known to be associated with the revolution. This
would leave the girl in as bad a plight as that from
which he had just rescued her. He shook off Sorez
and, picking up the girl, started into the small anteroom;
but before he was out of sight the first of the
soldiers had sprung up the steps. With an oath three
of the men seized him and drew him back, the girl still
in his arms, to the door. Jo roused herself and struggled
to her feet, facing the strange soldiers without
a sign of fear. Wilson reached his holster, but the
girl checked his hand, realizing, even in her torpid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
condition, the uselessness of it. In a minute others
flocked up the stairs and around them with noisy demonstration,
and soon, following these, the main body
of the regiment with a snappy gray-haired officer at
their head. The crowd, save for the two guards, gave
way from before the trio and left them confronting
their leader. By some description of Danbury&#8217;s or
by instinct, Wilson recognized him as none other than
Otaballo. This then was the main body of the Revolutionists!
Before he had time to speak Wilson saw
that his own identity was beginning to dawn on Otaballo.
He stepped forward and spoke the single word:</p>
<p>&#8220;Americans?&#8221;</p>
<p>The effect was magical. The soldiers drew back to
respectful attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Americans,&#8221; answered Wilson.</p>
<p>The general spoke in broken English.</p>
<p>&#8220;How came you here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am with Danbury,&#8221; answered Wilson. &#8220;The
girl and the man were in the dungeons below.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! These are the two captured by the&ndash;&ndash;the
late government?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I would like shelter for the girl. She is
very weak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Dios!</i> you shall have refuge at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned to one of his lieutenants and in Spanish
gave his command.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the name of the Queen seize the house opposite.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned back to Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will leave you five men; is that enough?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Otaballo at the head of his men proceeded to sterner
business, throwing out guards through the palace and
making the victory secure.</p>
<p>Half carrying the girl, Wilson followed the soldiers
across the street. Two of them supported Sorez. The
house opposite was empty, the occupants having deserted
it at the approach of the enemy. It was a
rambling, story-and-a-half structure, somewhat elaborately
furnished. Wilson placed a guard at the front
and rear of the place with orders to admit no one
until he had first seen them, and then carried the girl
upstairs. She was not asleep, but so nearly numb with
the strain that she could neither think nor speak. It
seemed to him that there was only one thing to do&ndash;&ndash;let
her sleep. Rest at present was more necessary than
food. On the second story there was a fine large bedroom,
with a big bed covered with snow-white linen.
He placed her upon this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sleep as long as you wish,&#8221; he bade her, though
he knew she scarcely heard his voice. &#8220;I shall be
outside.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before he closed the door he turned and saw her
breathing deeply with closed eyes. It seemed only
humane to care for Sorez. On the first floor he found
a divan and, with the help of the soldiers, arranged
him upon this, where he, too, was soon fast asleep.</p>
<p>Then he returned to the second floor and, lying down
before her door, was soon unconscious himself. How
long he lay so he could not tell, but he was aroused by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
the sound of shouting outside the house. Springing to
his feet, he listened at her door; there was no sound.
He opened it and looked within; she lay where he had
left her, still sleeping. Going to the window he looked
out and was surprised to find the street crowded with
citizens. It must have been long after noon, as he
could tell by the sun. From all appearances this was
some sort of a patriotic demonstration before the old
palace. He watched it with indifferent interest until
a closed carriage drove up. At this moment he saw
Stubbs himself step from the palace and at the side
of Otaballo approach the carriage. Here was his opportunity
to make known his whereabouts to his
partner. He tiptoed to the stairs and descended to
the first floor. He warned the guard at the exit once
more to admit no one and hurried out to push his way
to Stubbs&#8217; side. The crowd recognized him as an
American from his dress and opened up a path for him.
But even so he would not have reached his goal
had not Stubbs seen him and, with a glad shout of
welcome neglected his diplomatic duties to grasp the
hand of the man he thought dead. At this moment the
princess herself stepped from the vehicle and, ignoring
the applause of the multitude, turned her attention
to Wilson. She hesitated a moment, and then addressed
him, speaking faultless English:</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me, but are not you one&ndash;&ndash;one of Mr.
Danbury&#8217;s friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We both are,&#8221; answered Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your name is&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Wilson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, how fortunate! It is you of all men I wished
most to see. If&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; A shout from a thousand
throats rent the air. She looked dazed.</p>
<p>&#8220;If your Highness would bow,&#8221; suggested Otaballo.</p>
<p>She turned to the gathering, smiled, and bowed.
But her scant courtesy was scarcely finished before
her eyes were again upon Wilson and the anxious look
uppermost in them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must see you,&#8221; she commanded. &#8220;Follow me
into the palace.&#8221;</p>
<p>She raised the hem of her light dress and tripped
up the stairs looking more like a schoolgirl than a
queen. Wilson and Stubbs followed after Otaballo,
who appeared somewhat worried. They entered the
palace, and at her request a guard led them into the
privacy of a small room&ndash;&ndash;as it happened, the room
which Wilson had twice before visited that day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked you to come,&#8221; she began a bit nervously,
&#8220;because you seemed to be the friend of whom Dicky
talked to the last&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The last!&#8221; exclaimed Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, not that,&#8221; she assured him, grasping his fear.
&#8220;He isn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;isn&#8217;t dead. But you knew he was
wounded?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered quickly, &#8220;I had not heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Before the palace here and&ndash;&ndash;he was brought to
me. His wound isn&#8217;t so very serious, the doctor says,&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s
in his leg and he won&#8217;t be able to walk for some
time.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry for him,&#8221; said Wilson, sincerely. &#8220;If
there is anything I can do&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is! There is! I have had him carried to
his boat. He was unconscious and the doctor gave him
something to make him sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Drugged him?&#8221; he demanded roughly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only so that he would go quietly. Then I gave
the sailors orders to sail back home with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why did you wish him to go back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must tell you, and you will understand. Oh,
please to understand! He wanted to&ndash;&ndash;to stay and&ndash;&ndash;and
I wanted him to stay. I think if&ndash;&ndash;if it hadn&#8217;t
been for this trouble we&ndash;&ndash;we would have been married.
But now&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your station forbids it,&#8221; he finished for her with
a note of harshness in his voice.</p>
<p>She answered very quietly&ndash;&ndash;so quietly that it
chided him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it is not that. He doesn&#8217;t need any title men
might give him. I would have him King&ndash;&ndash;but my
people would only kill him. That is the reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; begged Wilson. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I did not
understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are very jealous&ndash;&ndash;my people. He would
have many enemies here&ndash;&ndash;enemies who wouldn&#8217;t
fight fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he made you Queen for this!&#8221; gasped Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t know&ndash;&ndash;did he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I want you to talk to him if he returns, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
tell him he mustn&#8217;t come back and get killed. Won&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will talk to him if I see him, but&ndash;&ndash;he will come
back just the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He mustn&#8217;t. You don&#8217;t understand fully the
danger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t make <i>him</i> understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>She put her clasped hands to her hot cheeks a
moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we could keep him away for a month&ndash;&ndash;just
a month. Then perhaps I could let someone else&ndash;&ndash;be&ndash;&ndash;be
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean to abdicate?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, couldn&#8217;t I? The General told me that if
I didn&#8217;t send him away at once you would all
be killed; but perhaps later&ndash;&ndash;when things have
quieted&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There will always be,&#8221; he warned, &#8220;a republic in
the heart of your kingdom. The quieter&ndash;&ndash;the more
danger.&#8221;</p>
<p>General Otaballo had remained in the rear of the
room doing his best to control his impatience, but now
he ventured to step forward. He saluted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me, your Highness, but they wait to make
you their Queen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t! Don&#8217;t!&#8221; she pleaded. &#8220;Leave me for
to-day just a maid of Carlina. To-morrow&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; answered the General, with some
severity, &#8220;to-morrow may be too late for all of us.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;That the situation now is a great deal more serious
than your Majesty seems to understand. We are victorious,
yes. But it is as difficult to maintain a victory
as to win one. To-day the crowd throw up their caps
for Beatrice, but if Beatrice spurns them and ignores
their loyal cheers, it takes but a trifle to turn their
thoughts the other way. Let me escort your Majesty
through the city; let me establish you in the palace
which has been graced by so many of your kin; let
them see you where their grandfathers saw your brave
aunt, and the last drop of blood in their veins is yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>She pouted like a child, her thoughts still upon other
things than crowns of human make.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want their blood. I don&#8217;t want to be
Queen. I want to be left alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked out the window to the blue sky so full of
gold and peace, where the birds tumbled at will, their
throats bursting with song.</p>
<p>&#8220;General,&#8221; she said, &#8220;leave me to-day, at any rate.
That is all I ask,&ndash;&ndash;just to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; he answered slowly, &#8220;it is not
mine to grant, not yours to take. Many things may
happen in a night,&ndash;&ndash;too many. There will be much
talking in the caf&eacute;s this evening, many gatherings of
men, much afoot before dawn. The forces brought
in by General Danbury already belong to anyone who
will pay them. It is not his fault,&ndash;&ndash;they fought well
for their money; but now they are equally ready to
fight again for someone else. You alone can hold
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
them to your cause. President Arlano escaped us and
is doubtless busy. If we gain the crowd, we are safe
against anything he may do; without the crowd, we
are in jeopardy. Once the people see you crowned&ndash;&ndash;once
they can shout for Beatrice with her before their
eyes, a living thing to fight for&ndash;&ndash;they are ours
forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Majesty has not fully considered the alternative;
it is that you and I and all the brave men who
fought to-day for you will be at the mercy of Arlano,&ndash;&ndash;at
the mercy of the man whose father slew your
aunt,&ndash;&ndash;at the mercy of the man who tortured to death
Banaca. It is a bloody mercy we would get. Beside
your own, a thousand lives depend upon what you do
before night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl drew back from him in fright. With the
memory of her quiet yesterday in the sun; the drowsy
yesterdays which preceded it; with the picture of this
very man who in the past had never stood to her for
anything but a pleasant companion at tea, the present
situation seemed absurd and unreal. What was she
that her insignificant actions should be of such moment?
She had but one object in mind: to place Danbury
without the power of all this strife, and she was
even balked in that. For the first time she realized
fully what a serious crisis he had precipitated. But
it was too late for her to check its results. If she went
now with General Otaballo, it would leave no possible
outlet for her to avoid assuming the title of Queen;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
she must mount the throne at once. To do this meant
to give up the greatest thing in her life. There was
no possible escape from it. Only by renouncing Danbury
utterly, by keeping him from Carlina, could she
save his life. The only alternative was to fly, but this
meant the sacrifice of too many other lives dear to her.
The loyal, aged man before her who had thrown the
remnant of his years into the cause was in itself
enough to banish such a thought from her mind.</p>
<p>And this was what Dick had come across the seas
to accomplish. It was a cruel jest of Fate. In his
desire to secure for her all that he in his big heart
thought she deserved, he had cheated her of the very
thing her soul most craved. Yes, it was cruel, cruel.
It would have been easier if he had not told her of his
love, if he at least had left it a thing merely to be
guessed at, a pleasant dream which she could have
kept always as a sort of fairy possibility.</p>
<p>Her cheeks lost their color as she faced the man who
watched her with fatherly solicitude. He stood waiting
like some Nemesis,&ndash;&ndash;waiting with the assurance
that she would act as all the royal women of her race
had always acted, bravely and loyally. From without
there came a fresh cheer from the impatient men who
waited for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You hear?&#8221; he asked gently.</p>
<p>Her lips scarcely moved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment she smothered her face in her hands.
This meant so much to her. It was not a matter of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
day, a week, a year; it was for a whole weary, lonesome
lifetime. Then she faced him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will come,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>He raised her fingers to his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Majesty has the blood of her race.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned a white face to Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They call me Queen, but
you see how helpless I am. You must tell him this
and you must not let him come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Otaballo held the door wide for her and she passed
out. From the bottom of his heart Wilson pitied her,
but this very pity brought to his mind that other
woman whom he himself had left behind. He hurried
out of the building after telling Stubbs where he could
be found, and across the street. He took the stairs
joyously, three at a time. The door of the room where
he had left her stood open. The bed within was empty.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3><i>Blind Alleys</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">For</span> a moment he stood there staring, wondering
if it could be only a dream that he had held her
in his arms, that he had brought her up here, that she
had lain upon this white bed which now mocked him
with its emptiness. Then he took a step into the room,
where he saw still the imprint of her head upon the
pillow. He turned at this and ran into the hall,
shouting her name. He was down the stairs in three
bounds. The couch where he had left Sorez was also
empty. The guard at the front door would not believe
when told; but the proof lay in the absence of the
guard in the rear. This door opened upon a small
garden surrounded by a low wall. A gate led from this
into a narrow street in the rear. If they were gone
far they must have left in a carriage, for neither of
them was strong enough to walk.</p>
<p>With a feeling of more bitter hatred than he had
ever felt against any man, he realized that Sorez must
have been in part shamming. That he was weak and
exhausted there could be no doubt; but it was equally
clear now that he was by no means so weak as he had
led Wilson to believe. Not even Stubbs could have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
drawn Wilson from the house, had he suspected Sorez
of being able to move from that couch within twelve
hours.</p>
<p>Wilson blamed himself for stupidity, for carelessness,
for almost criminal negligence in thus leaving the
girl. And yet one might as soon reckon on the dead
coming to life, as for this d&eacute;nouement. It was clear
that he was dealing with no ordinary man, but he
should have known this after the display of nerve he
had witnessed as Sorez had climbed the stairs in his
own house. He was a man with an iron will, with the
ability to focus whatever energy remained within him
upon a single objective. Through this Wilson gained
a ray of hope; even if he found it impossible to locate
him before, he knew that Sorez would press on to the
lake of Guadiva. No power, no force less than death
would serve to prevent him. Sooner or later Wilson
would meet his man there. The present pity of it was
that with the information he possessed, the secret of
the parchment, he might possibly have prevented this
journey and saved the girl much hardship.</p>
<p>So his brain reasoned, but back of this was the
throbbing ache that would not listen to reason. He
wanted her again within his arms; he wanted again
to look into her dark eyes, to feel again the warmth of
her breath against his neck. He wanted, too, the sense
of protecting and caring for her. He had meant to
do so much; to find a comfortable lodging place for
her until he could take her back; to forage food and
clothing for her. A hundred things unsaid whirled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
about in his brain; a hundred plans unfulfilled mocked
him; a hundred needs unsatisfied. For a few precious
moments he had held her in his arms,&ndash;&ndash;a few moments
when he craved years, and then he had lost her.
Perhaps there was still a chance. His own head was
too confused to form a plan at present. He determined
to return to the palace and seek Stubbs.</p>
<p>With the aid of two of Otaballo&#8217;s lieutenants he was
able to locate Stubbs, who was assisting the General in
an attempt to bring the mercenaries into some sort of
order. These men finally worn out, he had succeeded
in enticing into one of the big rooms where he had
calmly turned the lock upon them. Wilson greeted
Stubbs with the single exclamation:</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve gone again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&ndash;&ndash;the girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone,&#8221; groaned Wilson. &#8220;But within the hour. I
want you to help me find them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like huntin&#8217; fer a loose dory in th&#8217; dark, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but you&#8217;d hunt even for your dory, wouldn&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right, m&#8217; boy, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t suggestin&#8217; thet yer
change yer course, only&ndash;&ndash;these seas are uncharted
fer me. But how&#8217;d she git outern yer hands once
yer had her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I was a fool, Stubbs. I thought she would
sleep until night, and so came over here to let you
know where I was. That would have been all right
if I hadn&#8217;t stayed, but the Queen came and&ndash;&ndash;she
told you about Danbury?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; nodded Stubbs, &#8220;an&#8217; I can&#8217;t figger out
whether it&#8217;s right er wrong. At any rate, he&#8217;s taken
care of fer a couple weeks. I found out she told the
truth, and that the boat has gone. But about the girl&ndash;&ndash;have
you an idea where this pirate has taken her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No more than you have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t a stranger here, is he? Prob&#8217;ly has
friends, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. I know he has. I saw some of his
letters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Know who they are?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose we might find that out from the General&ndash;&ndash;he
must know him, for the man was a surgeon or
something in the armies here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two hours passed before they were able to reach the
General, and then they had but a word with him. The
girl had done his bidding and was now crowned Queen
of Carlina. Every loyal citizen of Bogova was out,
anxious to cheer himself hoarse before his neighbor.
From the outlying districts the natives were pouring
into the city as fast as they heard of the termination
of hostilities. Otaballo had his hands full with prospect
of more to do every hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone in Bogova knows Sorez,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;If he had been in the city for the last year I should
know more of his possible whereabouts than I do.
He was a surgeon in the Republican armies here, but
he took no active interest in the Republic. How little
his arrest proves. In fact, I think he stands in disfavor,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
owing to the trouble with the hill men, which
they think started with him. I&#8217;ve even heard him accused
of having stolen the image. But I don&#8217;t believe
that or I&#8217;d arrest him myself. As it is, I&#8217;d like to
have a talk with him. I can&#8217;t suggest where he is, but
I&#8217;ll give you a couple of men who know him and know
the city to help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; exclaimed Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the meanwhile,&#8221; he said, turning to Stubbs,
&#8220;I&#8217;m depending on you to keep those men in order.
If they only had their pay&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll get it as soon as we can reach Danbury.
It was you who sent him away, General.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a note of resentment in Stubbs&#8217; voice. He
had not at all approved of this act.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, I know. But&ndash;&ndash;I saved his life by it.
As soon as things settle down a bit it will be safer for
him. In the meanwhile, if we could get those men
out of the city. To be frank, I&#8217;m afraid of them.
Arlano might reach them and he could buy them with
a few pieces of gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not denying that,&#8221; said Stubbs, &#8220;unless ye
can give them <i>more</i> gold. As fer myself, I can&#8217;t promise
ye nothin&#8217;. I&#8217;ve finished my cruise with the captain
an&#8217; done my best. If he was here, I&#8217;d stick by
him still, but he ain&#8217;t, an&#8217; I&#8217;ve gut other things in
hand. Every mother&#8217;s son of the crew will git their
pay fer their work so far, but further, I dunno. They
done what they promised&ndash;&ndash;took the city fer ye. Now
if ye doesn&#8217;t watch &#8217;em I reckon they&#8217;ll take it fer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
themselves. As much as they can git in their pockets,
anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like that,&#8221; answered the General, darkly.
&#8220;If you&#8217;ll look after them&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wash my hands of them from now on,&#8221; broke in
Stubbs. &#8220;Havin&#8217; other duties.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Other duties here?&#8221; asked Otaballo, instantly
suspicious.</p>
<p>&#8220;The findin&#8217; of this gent Sorez bein&#8217; one of &#8217;em,&#8221;
answered Stubbs. &#8220;An&#8217; I guess we better be about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is for the sake of the girl,&#8221; explained Wilson.
&#8220;The one you saw me bringing from the dungeon.
Sorez kidnapped her from America, and now he has
taken her again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The General&#8217;s face brightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that is it!&#8221;</p>
<p>He summoned a lieutenant and held a brief whispered
conversation with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he concluded, turning to Wilson,
&#8220;Lieutenant Ordaz&ndash;&ndash;he will give you what assistance
you need.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; th&#8217; same,&#8221; said Stubbs, in a whisper to Wilson
as soon as they were upon the street again, &#8220;we&#8217;ll
proceed to lose. I didn&#8217;t like th&#8217; look in Oteerballo&#8217;s
eye when he give us this &#8217;ere travellin&#8217; mate.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was an easy enough task for Stubbs. At the end
of three or four blocks he instructed Wilson to detach
himself and go back to the last public house they had
passed and there wait for him. This Wilson did, and
in less than ten minutes Stubbs appeared alone.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Sorry ter part comp&#8217;ny with the gent, but with
him we wuz more likely ter find Oteerballo than Sorez.
&#8217;Nother thing, we has gotter do some plannin&#8217; &#8217;fore we
begins work. &#8217;Cause if I ain&#8217;t mistaken, we has a
long chase ahead. In th&#8217; fust place, how much gold
is yer carryin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gold? Not a dollar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought &#8217;bout thet amount. Next place, is yer
papers safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson felt of his pocket where they were tightly
pinned in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t lose those without losing my coat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Might lose yer coat in this here city. Next, how
&#8217;bout weapins?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson drew out the revolver which he had managed
to keep through all the confusion. In addition to that
he had some fifty cartridges loose in his pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; commented Stubbs. Then he took an
inventory of his own resources.</p>
<p>&#8220;In th&#8217; fust place, I has some three hundred dollars
in gold in this here leather belt &#8217;bout my waist. Never
had less in it since a &#8217;sperience I had forty year ago.
Fer weapins we is &#8217;bout equal. Now I figgers this
way; it will take us &#8217;bout a week to learn what we
has gotter learn &#8217;bout the coast beyond those hills afore
we takes chances on crossin&#8217; &#8217;em. We can git this
information at th&#8217; same time we is doin&#8217; what we
can to locate th&#8217; girl, though I ain&#8217;t reckonin&#8217; on seein&#8217;
her till we reaches th&#8217; lake. We can pick up our
outfit and our grub at th&#8217; same time.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>Wilson broke in.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the scheme, Stubbs. I want to get
to work and find the girl before she gets over the hills.
It&#8217;s too hard a trip for her&ndash;&ndash;it might kill her.
She&#8217;s weak now, but that brute wouldn&#8217;t care.
If&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Slow! Slow, m&#8217; son. Yer blood is hot, but
sometimes th&#8217; short course is th&#8217; longest. If we wastes
a week doin&#8217; nothin&#8217; but thet, we wastes another perhaps
arter we had found they has started. If we
makes ourselves sure of our course to th&#8217; treasure,
we makes sure of our course to th&#8217; girl. Thet is th&#8217;
only <i>sure</i> thing, an&#8217; when ye&#8217;ve gut big things at
stake it&#8217;s better ter be sure than quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you are right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Nother thing, m&#8217; son, &#8217;cordin&#8217; to my notions
this ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; ter be a partic&#8217;laly healthy place fer
&#8217;Mericans in a day er two. Now thet they have bamboozled
the Queen (an&#8217; she herself is as squar&#8217; a little
woman as ever lived) inter gittin&#8217; Danbury outer th&#8217;
city, an&#8217; now thet the fight is won fer &#8217;em, an&#8217; now
thet th&#8217; boys we brought is about ter raise hell (as they
certainly is), Otaballo ain&#8217;t goneter be squeamish
&#8217;bout removin&#8217; quiet like and safe everyone who
bothers him. In three days we might not be able
to git out long &#8217;nuff to git tergether an outfit er ask
any questions. There&#8217;s a whole lot &#8217;bout thet map
o&#8217; yourn thet we wanter understan&#8217; afore we starts,
as I looks at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is some sense in that.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a simple proposition; does ye want ter
gamble on losin&#8217; both chances fer th&#8217; sake of savin&#8217; a
week, or does yer wanter make sure of one fer the
double treasure&ndash;&ndash;gold and girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d give every penny of the treasure to get the
girl in my grip once again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ve gotter git yer treasure fust afore ye can
even do thet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it. I&#8217;m powerless as things are. If
there is a treasure there and we can get it, we&#8217;ll have
something to work with. If I had the money now,
I&#8217;d have fifty men on his track, and I&#8217;d post a hundred
along the trail to the lake to intercept him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If ye&#8217;d had the treasure, likely &#8217;nuff ye wouldn&#8217;t
have started. But ye ain&#8217;t gut it an&#8217; ye is a long,
long way from gettin&#8217; it. But if ye don&#8217;t divide yer
intrests, we is goin&#8217; ter git it, an&#8217; arter that we is
goin&#8217; ter git th&#8217; girl, if she&#8217;s anywhere atop th&#8217; earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you, Stubbs,&#8221; answered Wilson, with
renewed enthusiasm. &#8220;And I believe that with you
we can do it. We&#8217;ll make a bargain now; share and
share alike every cent we find. Give me your hand
on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stubbs reached his big hand across the table and
the two men shook.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we&#8217;ll have a bite to eat and a
mouthful to drink and begin work.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the next week they followed one faint clue
after another, but none of them led to anything.
Wilson managed to secure the names of many men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
who knew Sorez well and succeeded in finding some of
them; but to no purpose. He visited every hotel and
tavern in the city, all the railroad and steamship offices,
but received not a word of information that was of
any service. The two had disappeared as effectually as
though they had dropped from the earth.</p>
<p>At the advice of Stubbs he kept out of sight as much
as possible. The two had found a decent place to
board and met here each night, again separating in
the morning, each to pursue his own errands.</p>
<p>Both men heard plenty of fresh stories concerning
the treasure in the mountains. Rumors of this hidden
gold had reached the grandfathers of the present
generation and had since been handed down as fact.
The story had been strongly enough believed to inspire
several expeditions among the natives themselves
within the last twenty years, and also among
foreigners who traded here. But the information
upon which they proceeded had always been of the
vaguest so that it had come to be looked upon as a
fool&#8217;s quest.</p>
<p>The three hundred dollars was sufficient with
careful buying to secure what the two men needed.
Stubbs attended to all these details. They wished to
make themselves as nearly as possible independent of
the country, so that they could take any route which
seemed to be advisable without the necessity of keeping
near a base of supplies. So they purchased a
large quantity of tinned goods; beef, condensed milk,
and soup. Sugar, coffee, chocolate, flour, and salt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
made up the burden of the remainder. They also
took a supply of coca leaves, which is a native stimulant
enabling one to withstand the strain of incredible
hardships.</p>
<p>Each of them secured a good Winchester. They
were able to procure what ammunition they needed.
A good hunting knife completed the armament of each.</p>
<p>For clothing they wore on their feet stout mountain
shoes and carried a lighter pair in their kits. They
had khaki suits and flannel shirts, with wide Panama
sombreros. At the last moment Stubbs thought to add
two picks, a shovel, and a hundred feet or more of
stout rope. Wilson had made a copy of the map with
the directions, and each man wore it attached to a
stout cord about his neck and beneath his clothing.</p>
<p>It was in the early morning of August 21 that the
two finally left Bogova, with a train of six burros
loaded with provisions and supplies for a three months&#8217;
camping trip, and a native guide.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3><i>The Spider and the Fly</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">The</span> sun came warmly out of a clear sky as they
filed out of the sleeping town. To the natives
and the guide they passed readily enough as American
prospectors and so excited no great amount of interest.
The first stage of their journey was as pleasant as a
holiday excursion. Their course lay through the
wooded foothills which lie between the shore and the
barren desert. The Cordilleras majestic, white capped,
impressive, are, nevertheless, veritable hogs. They
drink up all the moisture and corral all the winds from
this small strip which lies at their feet. Scarcely once
in a year do they spare a drop of rain for these lower
planes. And so within sight of their white summits
lies this stretch of utter desolation.</p>
<p>It was not until the end of the first day&#8217;s journey
that they reached this barren waste. To the Spanish
looters this strip of burning white, so oddly located,
must have seemed a barrier placed by Nature to protect
her stores of gold beyond. But it doubtless only
spurred them on. They passed this dead level in a
day and a half of suffocating plodding, and so reached
the second lap of their journey.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></div>
<p>The trail lies broad and smooth along the lower
ranges, for, even neglected as it has been for centuries,
it still stands a tribute to the marvelous skill of those
early engineers. The two men trudged on side by
side climbing ever higher in a clean, bracing atmosphere.
It would have been plodding work to any who
had lesser things at stake, but as it was the days
passed almost as in a dream. With each step, Wilson
felt his feet growing lighter. There was a firmness
about his mouth and a gladness in his eyes which
had not been there until now.</p>
<p>On the third day they reached the highest point of
the trail and started down. Both men had felt the
effects of the thin air during the last twelve hours and
so the descent came as a welcome relief. They camped
that night among trees and in an atmosphere that
relieved their tired lungs. They also built the first
fire they had lighted since the start and enjoyed a
hot meal of coffee and toasted porkscraps. They found
the steep downward trail to be about as difficult as the
upward one, as they were forced to brace themselves
at every step. By night they had come to the wooded
slopes of the table-lands below, supported by the
mighty buttresses of the Andes. It was a fair land
in which they found themselves&ndash;&ndash;a land which, save
for the vista of snow-capped summits and the lesser
volcanic peaks, might have passed for a fertile Northern
scene. It was at about sunset that they stopped
and Gaspar, the guide, pointed to a spindle lava top
against the sky.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Up there,&#8221; he informed them, &#8220;is the lake of
Guadiva. Some say it is there that the great treasure
lies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So? What treasure?&#8221; asked Stubbs, innocently.</p>
<p>&#8220;The treasure of the Gilded God which these people
worship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stubbs listened once again to the story which he
had already heard a dozen times. But it came with
fresh interest when told within sight of its setting.
Then he stared at it until the dark blotted it out.
And after that he lighted his pipe and stared at where
he had last seen it. Below them a few fires burned
in the darkness showing through the windows of the
adobe huts.</p>
<p>The next morning they dismissed their guide, as
it would be impossible to use him further without revealing
the object of their journey. Both Stubbs and
Wilson were anxious to push forward to the lake without
delay and resolved to reach if possible their goal
by night. They figured that as the crow flies it could
not be more than twenty-five miles distant. The trail
was direct and well enough marked and finally brought
them to the village of Soma which is within eight
miles of the base of the cone. Here, for the first time
since they started, they had a glimpse of the natives.
As they entered the small village of adobe huts they
were surrounded by a group of the beardless brown
men. In a few minutes their number had increased
till they formed a complete circle some ten men deep.
They did not seem unfriendly, but as they stood there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
chattering among themselves they made no motion
to open a path for the travelers. They were ordinarily
a peaceful people&ndash;&ndash;these of the valley of the
Jaula&ndash;&ndash;and certainly in appearance looked harmless
enough. Yet there was no doubt but what
now they had deliberately blocked the path of these
two.</p>
<p>Wilson looked to Stubbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks as though we had been brought to anchor.
D&#8217; ye know &#8217;nuff Spanish to say &#8216;Howdy&#8217; to &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps a few presents would talk better?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too many of &#8217;em. Try your parley-vous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Might move ahead a bit first and see what
happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then get a grip on your gun, m&#8217; boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; objected Wilson, sharply. &#8220;You&#8217;d have
a fight in a minute. Move ahead as though we did
not suspect we were checked.&#8221;</p>
<p>He flicked the haunches of the leading burro and
the patient animal started automatically. But soon
his nose reached the breast of an impassive brown man.
Wilson stepped forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Greeting,&#8221; he said in Spanish.</p>
<p>He received no response.</p>
<p>&#8220;Greetings to the chief. Gifts for the chief,&#8221; he
persisted.</p>
<p>The eyes of the little man in front of him blinked
back with no inkling of what lay behind them. It
was clear that this was a preconceived, concerted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
movement. It looked more serious. But Stubbs called
cheerily to him:</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, m&#8217; boy, there&#8217;s one thing we can do;
wait for <i>them</i> to make a move. Sit down an&#8217; make
yerself comfortable an&#8217; see what happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>They gathered the six burros into a circle, tied them
with their heads together and then squatted back to
back upon the ground beside them. Stubbs drew out
his pipe, filled, and lighted it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep yer gun within reach,&#8221; he warned in an
undertone to Wilson. &#8220;Maybe they don&#8217;t mean no
harm; maybe they does. We&#8217;ll make &#8217;em pay heavy
fer what they gits from us, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The surrounding group watched them with silent
interest, but at the end of a half hour during which
nothing happened more exciting than the relighting
of Stubbs&#8217; pipe, they appeared uneasy. They found
the strangers as stoical as the burros. Many of the
men lounged off, but their places were promptly filled
by the women and children so that the circle remained
intact. Wilson grew impatient.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be interesting to know whether or not
we are prisoners,&#8221; he growled.</p>
<p>&#8220;When yer feel like beginnin&#8217; the row we can find
out that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should feel as though shooting at children to fire
into this crowd.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thet&#8217;s what they be&ndash;&ndash;jus&#8217; so many naked kids;
but Lord, they can swing knives like men if they&#8217;re
like sim&#8217;lar children I&#8217;ve seen.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re losing valuable time. We might make
another move and try to shoulder our way through
until the knives appear and then&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He was interrupted by a movement in the crowd.
The men fell back to make a path for a tall, lank
figure who stepped forward with some show of dignity.
Both Wilson and Stubbs exclaimed with one breath:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Priest!&#8221;</p>
<p>To Wilson he was the man who had tried to kill
him in the dark, the man again whom he in his turn
had tried to kill. He reached for his holster, but he
saw that even now the man did not recognize him.
The priest, however, had detected the movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are too many of us,&#8221; he smiled, raising a
warning finger. &#8220;But no harm is meant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Save for the second or two he had seen him during
the fight, this was the first time Wilson had ever had an
opportunity to study the man closely. He was puzzled
at first by some look in the man&#8217;s face which haunted
him as though it bore some resemblance to another face.
It did not seem to be any one feature,&ndash;&ndash;he had never
before seen in anyone such eyes; piercing, troubled
dark eyes, moving as though never at ease; he had
never seen in anyone such thin, tight lips drawn over
the teeth as in a man with pain. The nose was normal
enough and the cheek-bones high, but the whole expression
of the face was one of anxious intensity, of
fanatical ardor, with, shadowing it all, an air of puzzled
uncertainty. Everything about the man was more
or less of a jumbled paradox; he was dressed like a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
priest, but he looked like a man of the world; he was
clearly a native in thought and action, but he looked more
like an American. He stared at Stubbs as though bewildered
and unable to place him. Then his face cleared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is your master?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cap&#8217;n?&#8221; growled Stubbs, anything but
pleased at the form and manner of the question.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not his keeper and no man is my master.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he live?&#8221;</p>
<p>Briefly Wilson told of what had been done with
Danbury. The Priest listened with interest. Then
he asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;And your mission here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Before Wilson could frame a reply, the Priest waved
his hand impatiently to the crowd which melted away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come with me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am weary and need
to rest a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Priest preceded them through the village and
to an adobe hut which stood at a little distance from
the other houses and was further distinguished by
being surrounded by green things. It was a story-and-a-half-high
structure, thatched with straw.</p>
<p>On the way Wilson managed to whisper to Stubbs:</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me do the talking.&#8221;</p>
<p>The latter nodded surlily.</p>
<p>Before entering the hut the Priest gave an order to
two of his followers to look after the animals. He
caught a suspicious glance from Stubbs as the native
led them away.</p>
<p>&#8220;The brutes look thirsty and I told the boy to give
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
them food and drink. The Sun God loves all dumb
things.&#8221;</p>
<p>The room in which they found themselves contained no
furniture other than a table, a few chairs, and against
one wall a bunk covered with a coarse blanket. The floor
was of hard clay and uncovered. From one side of the
room there led out a sort of anteroom, and from here he
brought out a bottle of wine with three wooden goblets.</p>
<p>The afternoon sun streamed in at the open windows,
throwing a golden alley of light across the table; the
birds sang without and the heavy green leaves brushed
whisperingly against the outer walls. It was a picture
of summer peace and simplicity. But within
this setting, Wilson knew there lurked a spirit that was
but the smile which mocks from a death&#8217;s head. There
was less to be feared from that circle of childlike
eyes with which they had been surrounded outside,
burning with however much antagonism, than from
this single pair of sparkling beads before them, which
expressed all the intelligence of a trained intellect
strangely mixed with savage impulses and superstition.
The Priest poured each of them a cup of sparkling
wine and raised his goblet to his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;If my children,&#8221; he said, almost as though in
apology, &#8220;do not like strangers, it is after all the fault
of strangers of the past. Some of them have respected
but little the gods of my people. You are, I presume,
prospecting?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After a fashion,&#8221; answered Wilson. &#8220;But we
prospect as much for friends as gold.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That is better. You people are strange in your
lust for gold. It leads you to do&ndash;&ndash;things which were
better not done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is our chief weapon in our world,&#8221; answered
Wilson. &#8220;You here have other weapons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With but little need of them among ourselves,&#8221;
he answered slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you go a long way to protect your gold,&#8221; retorted
Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for the sake of the gold itself. Our mountains
guard two treasures; one is for whoever will,
the other is for those not of this world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We go for a treasure very much of this world,&#8221;
answered Wilson, with a smile; &#8220;in fact, for a woman.
She has ventured in here with one Sorez.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not a line of his lean face altered. He looked back
at Wilson with friendly interest&ndash;&ndash;with no suspicion of
the important part he had already played in his life.</p>
<p>&#8220;This&ndash;&ndash;this man searches for gold?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&ndash;&ndash;for the great treasure of which so many
speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was the very slightest tightening of the lips,
the merest trace of a frown between the brows.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is unwise; the treasure of the Gilded God is
well guarded. Yes, even from him.&#8221;</p>
<p>A big purple butterfly circled through the sunshine
and fluttered a moment above the spilled wine upon
the table; then it vanished into the dark. The Priest
watched it and then glanced up.</p>
<p>&#8220;The maid&ndash;&ndash;what part does she play?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></div>
<p>&#8220;She is under some strange spell the man has cast
over her, I think, for she has been led to believe the
wildest sort of a yarn&ndash;&ndash;a tale that her father, long
missing, is somewhere about these mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her father&ndash;&ndash;missing?&#8221; repeated the Priest, his
face clouding uneasily.</p>
<p>&#8220;The girl loved him as a comrade as well as a
father. The two were alone and very much together.
He was a captain, and some fifteen years ago disappeared.
It was thought that he sailed for some port
along the western coast, but he never came back. In
time the report came that he was dead, though this was
never proven.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Priest rubbed a brown skinny hand over his
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the maid did not believe the rumor?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;she did not believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson did not dare tell him of the crystal gazing
for fear that the Priest might jump to the conclusion
that it was this power Sorez was using and so would
associate the girl too closely with the treasure hunt.
Yet he wished to tell him enough to protect the girl
from any scheme of vengeance this man might be
planning against Sorez himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is very immature,&#8221; explained Wilson, &#8220;and
so believed the older man easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have come in search of her&ndash;&ndash;to take her
back.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But does she wish to return?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can make her see&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is difficult to make a woman see sometimes. It
is possible that she was led to come to Bogova in search
of her father&ndash;&ndash;but that would not bring her over the
mountains. There are other things&ndash;&ndash;like all women
she is fond of gold and jewels?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That may be,&#8221; answered Wilson, with heat. &#8220;But
if you knew her, you would understand that no such
motive would lead her to venture so much and endure
so much. Nothing could blind her eyes to common
sense but such a motive as this which drove her on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Priest smiled; he detected the underlying
incentive in Wilson&#8217;s own hazard, but there was still
Stubbs and his relation to Danbury. He suspected
treachery of some sort.</p>
<p>Wilson grew impatient.</p>
<p>&#8220;Night is coming on and we ought to be on our way.
I suppose you are in authority over these people.
Without your consent we cannot proceed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;but it is far from my intention to interfere
with so worthy a mission as yours. I might even assist
you. I am always glad to do anything that will help
strangers to leave. Sometimes this is done in one way
and&ndash;&ndash;sometimes in another. I expected this Sorez to
leave by to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow? Why, he can&#8217;t have more than
reached the lake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but strangers do not remain long by the lake.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the last few moments the Priest had seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
more normal, but now the uncanny, fanatical look returned
to his eyes. Stubbs nudged Wilson to rise.</p>
<p>The three moved towards the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not interfere with you&ndash;&ndash;at present,&#8221;
said the Priest. &#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;a word of advice&ndash;&ndash;work
quickly. As far as the girl is concerned I think she
will be ready to return by to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have seen her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not myself, but I have a thousand eyes seeing for
me in these mountains. They have seen the girl and
they tell me she is well,&ndash;&ndash;so much for your comfort.&#8221;</p>
<p>But there was a smile still about the corners of the
mouth which Wilson did not like.</p>
<p>The Priest shifted his eyes to the caravan itself.
He made a note of the picks and shovels.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have the implements,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;for
grave digging. I trust you will not need to use them.
<i>Adios</i>, my friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>He watched them until they disappeared into the
woods with a sinister, self-confident smile like a spider
watching a fly take the path into his web; a smile
that gave him an expression strangely like that of
the image itself. Before he turned into the hut again
he gave several orders. Three of the brown men
melted into the shadows after the caravan.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3><i>In the Footsteps of Quesada</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">Once</span> out of hearing, Stubbs, who had not spoken
a word, broke out.</p>
<p style="clear: both; padding-top: 1.5px;">&#8220;If there ever was a devil treading the earth, it&#8217;s
that man. I&#8217;ve tol&#8217; Danbury so from the first. Ye
can&#8217;t trust that sort. My fingers jus&#8217; itched along the
butt of my weapin&#8217; all the while ye was talkin&#8217;.
Seems though a man oughter have a right to plug sech
as him an&#8217; be done with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re prejudiced, Stubbs. I&#8217;ll admit the man
is queer, but, after all, he is protecting his own beliefs
and his own people. <a name="P237"></a>I don&#8217;t know as I would trust
him any further than you, but&ndash;&ndash;he is something of
a pathetic figure, too, Stubbs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks to me almost like an exile. I&#8217;ve got more
to hate him for than you have, but I don&#8217;t very long
at a time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ve got more t&#8217; like him for, too; he&#8217;s doin&#8217;
his best to git rid of Sorez fer you. But I says, &#8216;Watch
him. Watch him day an&#8217; night&ndash;&ndash;mos&#8217; particlarly at
night.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But what did he mean by to-morrow? I don&#8217;t
know but what we ought to let the treasure go and find
Sorez first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Find Sorez and ye has ter help him; help him
and the Priest fixes us immejiate. Then where&#8217;s yer
girl? No, th&#8217; thing for us ter do is ter git th&#8217; treasure
first and get it quick. Then we has somethin&#8217; ter work
with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if the treasure isn&#8217;t there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get the girl an&#8217; make a run for home. The Priest
won&#8217;t touch her so long as he thinks she is jus&#8217; bein&#8217;
fooled. If we joins th&#8217; band, he won&#8217;t think so an&#8217;
will kill us all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know but what you&#8217;re right,&#8221; answered
Wilson.</p>
<p>They pushed their tired animals on to the foot of
the mountain and, pausing here just long enough to
catch their breath, began the long ascent. It was
no child&#8217;s play from the first. The path was narrow,
rocky, and steep, blocked by undergrowth and huge
boulders, many of which at a touch became loosened
and plunged with a crashing roar down the slope behind
them. With any lesser incentive than that which
drove them on, they would have stopped a dozen
times.</p>
<p>Ahead of them loomed the broken crater edge with
just below it a fringe of stubby trees which broke off
abruptly where the barren lava began. The cone was
like a huge sugar loaf with the upper third cut off
unevenly. The edges were sharp and made a wild
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
jumble of crags which were broken by many deep
fissures. Here and there the mountain was split into
a yawning chasm. But the growth extended to within
about an eighth of a mile of the top. Here it stopped
and the path became nothing but a dizzy climb up a
slope as steep and smooth as a house roof.</p>
<p>They tethered their animals on the edge of the
green growth and here Stubbs set about making a
camping place for the night.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want the dark comin&#8217; down on me,&#8221; he
growled as Wilson suggested leaving their things and
pushing on to the top, &#8220;not until I finds a solid place
fer my back where nothin&#8217; can come up behin&#8217;. You
go on if ye wants to, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll git things settled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson hesitated, but in the end he was drawn on.
She lay beyond, somewhere upon the shores of the
lake. It was a scramble almost upon hands and knees.
It looked as though it were an impossibility for men
heavily laden ever to make their way to the top. He
turned once to look back, and saw behind him the
green sweep of the beautiful valley of Jaula&ndash;&ndash;then
mile upon mile of heavy timber which extended to
where the lusty mountains began once more. He
attacked the trail anew and at the end of twenty
minutes reached the top, bruised, cut, and exhausted.
He looked down within the cone&ndash;&ndash;not upon death
and desolation, not upon ashes and tumbled rock, but
upon the blue waters of the lake of Guadiva. It lay
nestled within the bosom of this cone at a depth of
just where, on the outside, the green began. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
sun had set early upon it and it now lay a grayish-blue
surface surrounded by a luxuriant tangle of
growing things. In a circle about it stood the dark
buttress of the lava sides. <a name="P240"></a>It was like a turquoise set
in stone. The contrast to its surroundings was as
startling as a living eye of faultless blue in a grinning
skull.</p>
<p>He did not have long to look at it&ndash;&ndash;not long to
search its borders for some sign of the living. The
dark came swiftly. As he was about to turn back,
he thought he caught a glimpse of a spiral of smoke
upon the farther side, but as he stared at this, it faded
until he was not sure it had been at all. He took
it for a good-night message from her. Then gold and
jewels, though they might be within arm&#8217;s reach,
became as nothing before the deep desire which almost
dragged his heart from his body&ndash;&ndash;which almost
sent him scrambling down the steep sides within the
cone to make a wild dash to reach her side that
night.</p>
<p>When he returned, he found Stubbs anxiously
waiting for him with supper ready and a shelter for
the night picked out beneath two large rocks which
effectively guarded their rear.</p>
<p>The next morning, as soon as the sun tipped with
pink the snow-capped tops of the Andes, Stubbs was
up and studying the map again. The air during the
night had been sharp, but snugly wrapped in their
blankets both men had secured a sound sleep. Towards
the early morning, however, Wilson had begun
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
to toss a little with thoughts of Jo. It was of her he
first spoke. Stubbs interrupted him sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, m&#8217; son,&#8221; he said with some irritation,
&#8220;we ain&#8217;t got but a darned short time in which to
work. So th&#8217; only way is to mark out a course now
and stick to it. While you&#8217;ve been dreamin&#8217; of yer
lady-love&ndash;&ndash;which is right an&#8217; proper&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ve been
thinkin&#8217; on how we can git her an&#8217; the other thing
too. Here&#8217;s the pint I hed reached when you interrupted
me: first and foremost, ye can&#8217;t git th&#8217; girl
until ye gits suthin&#8217; to git her with. Sorez ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217;
to listen to you until ye can show him he&#8217;s wrong.
He ain&#8217;t goneter b&#8217;lieve he&#8217;s wrong until ye can show
him th&#8217; treasure. Secondly, the Priest gent ain&#8217;t
goneter sleep till he finds out what fer we are wanderin&#8217;
&#8217;round here. Thirdly, when he does find out,
it ain&#8217;t goneter be comfortable, as ye might say, to be
seen in this here harbor. Fourthly, it ain&#8217;t goneter be
easy to git away with what we does find with a couple
of hundred natives at our heels, which they will be
mighty soon. So, says I, we&#8217;d better quit dreamin&#8217;
an&#8217; begin fishin&#8217; right erway.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused to see what effect this had. Wilson
nodded for him to go on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll take another p&#8217;int; this here map
starts from the hut where the heathen image lived.
Wherefore we&#8217;ve got ter find thet hut afore we can
start. We&#8217;ve gotter lay our course from thet. So,
says I, there&#8217;s jus&#8217; one thing ter do&ndash;&ndash;hunt fer it
lively.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></div>
<p>&#8220;On the other hand,&#8221; broke in Wilson, &#8220;if Sorez
is in danger, the girl is in danger. The treasure is
going to be here for a while longer, but maybe the
girl won&#8217;t. If we could combine forces with
Sorez&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m damned!&#8221; growled Stubbs. &#8220;See
here, m&#8217; boy, the only thing that will do is to
bring the Priest down on <i>us.</i> If Sorez wasn&#8217;t crazy,
he wouldn&#8217;t have come in here with thet idol with
less than a regiment back of him. But he has, an&#8217;
what we wanter do is ter keep outer the squall he&#8217;s
in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand the man. He is absolutely
fearless. He knows the place&ndash;&ndash;he knows the natives&ndash;&ndash;he
knows the Priest. He won&#8217;t be caught
napping.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe so. Then he don&#8217;t need us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson sprang to his feet. He was half ashamed
of an obsession which shut out thought of everything
else but the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Stubbs,&#8221; he blurted out, &#8220;you&#8217;re right
and I&#8217;m a sickly sentimentalist. I&#8217;ve been thinking
so much of her that I&#8217;m not fit for an expedition of
this sort. But from now on I&#8217;m under your orders.
We&#8217;ll get this heathen treasure&ndash;&ndash;and we&#8217;ll take
it down and show it to Sorez&ndash;&ndash;and we&#8217;ll take the
girl and fight our way out if we have to. As you
say, we haven&#8217;t much time and we&#8217;ve got to work
hard. We know the hut is near the cone and overlooks
the lake. Let&#8217;s see&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></div>
<p>He reached for the map which he had fastened
about his neck, but Stubbs checked his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy, boy. Jus&#8217; as well not to let the shadders
know we has maps. I&#8217;ve gut my copy here hidden
in the grass. S&#8217;posin&#8217; the hut is in the center; this
here docyment mentions two peaks&ndash;&ndash;one &#8216;kissed
by the sun&#8217; which I take it is the highest, and t&#8217; other
where &#8216;the trees climb highest.&#8217; Now at sea we often
lays our course inshore by jus&#8217; sech marks. I figgers
it out this way; these p&#8217;ints bein&#8217; startin&#8217; p&#8217;ints from
the hut mus&#8217; be somewhere nigh the hut. So if we
finds the tallest peak on the horizon an&#8217; then the peak
on the cone where the trees come up the farthest an&#8217;
gits the two in line, we&#8217;ll have a straight course for
the hut. Ain&#8217;t thet so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it is; maybe it ain&#8217;t. Anyhow, it&#8217;s wuth
tryin&#8217;. Now I&#8217;m for givin&#8217; the burros lots er rope
an&#8217; lettin&#8217; &#8217;em nibble here. Then we&#8217;ll hide our provisions
in one place an&#8217; our ammunition in another
and start immedjiate. I &#8217;spect there&#8217;s a dozen of
them niggers watchin&#8217; us. We&#8217;ll take a good look
roun&#8217; fore we begin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both men beat the bushes for the radius of a hundred
rods or more without, however, bringing to light anything
but a few birds. Then Stubbs piled the provisions
and blankets together with the picks and
shovels into a crevice between the rocks and covered
them with dry leaves and bits of sticks. He made
another reconnoitre before hiding the ammunition.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
This he finally buried in another crevice, covering it
so skillfully that not a leaf beneath which it lay looked
as though it had been disturbed. He piled a few stones
in one place, notched a tree in another, and left a bit
of his handkerchief in a third spot, to mark the cach&eacute;.
Then, shouldering their rifles, the two men began the
ascent.</p>
<p>Refreshed by their rest and the brisk morning air,
they reached the summit easily and once again Wilson
gazed down upon the lake now reflecting golden sunbeams
until it looked as though it were of molten gold
itself. Even Stubbs was moved by its beauty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorter makes you feel like worshipin&#8217; suthin&#8217;
yerself,&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>But he was the practical one of the two, or they
would have got no further. His eyes swept the surrounding
circle of peaks until they rested upon a
majestic pile which so clearly overtopped its fellows
as to leave no doubt that this must be the one &#8220;kissed
by the sun.&#8221; To the right from where they stood the
second landmark was equally distinct, the green
creeping up its sides several hundred rods higher than
upon the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;There ye are!&#8221; he exclaimed, pointing them out
to Wilson. &#8220;Clear as though they was labeled. An&#8217;
now we can&#8217;t stand here admirin&#8217; the scenery. There
ain&#8217;t no trolley to where we&#8217;re bound.&#8221;</p>
<p>He led the way, keeping as closely as possible to the
crater&#8217;s edge. But the path was a rugged one and
frequently broken by half-hidden ravines which often
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
drove them down and in a wide circle around. It was
a place for sure feet and sound nerves for they
skirted the edge of sheer falls of hundreds of feet.
<a name="P245A"></a>Before they reached a position opposite the crater peak,
they found themselves almost down to the green line
again. Here they discovered a sort of trail&ndash;&ndash;scarcely
marked more than a sheep path, but still fairly well
outlined. They followed this to the top again. When
they looked down upon the lake and across to the
distant summit, they found the two landmarks in line.
But neither to the right nor to the left could they see
the hut&ndash;&ndash;that magnet which had drawn them for so
many miles over the sea. Stubbs looked disconsolate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said finally, &#8220;jus&#8217; my luck. Mighter
known better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we haven&#8217;t given up yet,&#8221; said Wilson.
&#8220;Did you expect to find a driveway leading to it?
You get out to the right and I&#8217;ll explore to the left.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stubbs had not been gone more than ten minutes
before he heard a shout from Wilson and hurrying
to his side found him peering into a small stone hut
scarcely large enough to hold more than a single man.</p>
<p>As the two stood there they felt for the first time
the possibilities which lay before them. <a name="P245B"></a>The quest
loomed larger and more real than ever before. From a
half ghost treasure it became a reality. As the first actual
proof of the verity of the map which they possessed
it gave them a keener vision of what was to come.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord, if it should be true!&#8221; gasped Stubbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Man&ndash;&ndash;man, it is!&#8221; cried Wilson. &#8220;I feel it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
tingling through every vein. We are on the very edge
of the biggest treasure a man ever found!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&ndash;&ndash;did the paper say there was? Can you
remember?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gold plate and jewels&ndash;&ndash;over six hundred pieces.
No one knows how valuable they are. Each one might
be a fortune in itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gawd!&#8221;</p>
<p>Stubbs sat down on the threshold of the little hut.
He drew out his pipe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s jus&#8217; think on &#8217;t a minute,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It was not so much the money value these things
represented that appealed to the men. They could
not grasp that. Nor was it the intrinsic beauty of the
objects themselves. It was just the thrilling consciousness
of being within that golden zone which had
been sought by so many during so many centuries.
Men from the four corners of the earth had come in
search of what now lay within a day&#8217;s reach of them;
brave men, men who had made history. Yet they had
failed; the mountains had kept their secret and the
little blue lake had laughed at their efforts.</p>
<p>Wilson broke the spell. He was feverish with the
desire to go farther. It was the exciting finish to a
long race; the last move in a puzzle which had challenged
men for centuries.</p>
<p>&#8220;The map, Stubbs! We mustn&#8217;t stop here now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stubbs put up his pipe and unrolled once more the
bit of parchment. The directions now seemed brutally
calm.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></div>
<p>&#8220;From where the peaks kiss,&#8221; he read, &#8220;take one
hundred strides to the right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must go back to there,&#8221; said Wilson. &#8220;Come
on.&#8221;</p>
<p>He led the way at a run. This starting point was a
distance of several hundred yards from the hut itself.
From there Wilson took the stated number of steps.
He stopped with a start upon the brink of a hidden
precipice. The chasm was narrow, scarcely ten feet
wide, and from where he stood slanted so that the
bottom could not be seen. But a little way to the
right of here one looked into a sheer drop which ended
in darkness. Wilson wiped his forehead.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we had better remember what the Priest
says about those with unsteady steps. Another yard
and I would have gone down.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Stubbs was again bending over the map.</p>
<p>&#8220;The brave do not falter,&#8221; it read, &#8220;for the seeming
is not always the true. The path leads down twice the
length of a man&#8217;s body, then ten paces to the left.
Again the seeming is not true, for it leads back again
and under.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord!&#8221; exclaimed Stubbs, &#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t he put
this in plain English. There is no sense in that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The path leads down,&#8221; repeated Wilson. &#8220;That
can mean but one thing; it leads over the edge here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To what? You get into that hole an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have a closer look.&#8221;</p>
<p>The opposite side was smooth and sloped in so that
it was lost beneath the side upon which they stood.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
A man dropping over would strike this slanting
surface.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we had brought a bit of rope now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to take the next best thing,&#8221; said
Wilson. &#8220;Peel off your coat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to go over the side, m&#8217; son?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only twice the length of a man&#8217;s body,&#8221; repeated
Wilson. &#8220;If that is so, I ought to strike something
below&ndash;&ndash;a ledge&ndash;&ndash;that we can&#8217;t see now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better wait until we can get a rope. If it ain&#8217;t
so, you may drop a mile.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would take two hours to go back. I believe
that phrase &#8216;the seeming is not always the true&#8217; means
something. Those things were not put in there for
nothing. And it isn&#8217;t likely that such a treasure as
this was hidden where it could ever be found by
accident.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had stripped off his coat and stood waiting impatiently
for Stubbs. The latter delayed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be damned if you go down there,&#8221; he said
finally. &#8220;If anyone goes, it&#8217;s me. In these sorter
hills ye can&#8217;t tell how deep a hole is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t drop any farther than you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe not. But if anyone gits foolish round
here, it&#8217;s me.&#8221; He added, looking Wilson squarely
in the eyes, &#8220;There ain&#8217;t no one waiting fer me to
come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Wilson refused to listen.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place, I&#8217;m the lighter man, Stubbs;
and in the second, I&#8217;m the younger. This isn&#8217;t a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
matter for sentiment, but bull strength. I&#8217;m in
earnest, Stubbs; I&#8217;m going.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment Stubbs considered the advisability
of attempting to knock him down. It seemed foolish
for the boy to risk his life to save a matter of two
hours. But when he met again the stubborn eyes
and the jaw which was locked upon the resolution,
he recognized the futility of further protest. He took
off his coat and they tied the two sleeves together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once more afore ye start, boy,&ndash;&ndash;won&#8217;t ye consider?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stubbs, this isn&#8217;t like you. There is no danger.
Get a good brace with your feet. You won&#8217;t have to
bear the full weight because I can climb a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without more ado Wilson let himself slowly over the
edge. He slipped the length of the sleeves, his feet
dangling in the air over what depth he did not know.
He swung his toes in either direction and felt them
strike the opposite wall. He lowered himself a bit
more, and his toe rested upon what seemed a firm
platform. He was on a projection from the opposite
cliff face which slanted under. He let go the sleeve
and looked down. He found he could step from here
to a narrow path upon the nigh side where at this
point the two walls came almost together. He was
now beneath the place where he had started, which
hung over him like a canopy. The walls again
separated below, revealing a dark cavern.</p>
<p>At the end of a few steps taken with his face flat to
the rock, he found himself again on a narrow trail
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
which threaded its way over a yawning chasm. He
moved slowly, shuffling one foot ahead and dragging
the other after it. In this way he had gone perhaps
one hundred feet when the path seemed to come to an
abrupt end. His foot dangled over nothing. He almost
lost his balance. When he recovered himself,
he was so weak and dizzy that it was with difficulty
he clung to the rock. In a moment he was able to think.
He had been moving on a downward slope and it was
probable that this was only a more abrupt descent in
the shape of steps. One thing was sure: the path
did not end here, if it really was a path, and not a
chance formation. The opposite ledge had constantly
receded until it was now some thirty feet distant.
The path upon which he stood had narrowed until
it was scarcely over eighteen inches wide at this spot.
There was one other possibility: the ledge at this
point might have crumbled and fallen. In his progress
he had loosened many stones which rattled downwards
out of hearing.</p>
<p>He secured a good balance on his left foot and
cautiously lowered the other. Inch by inch he groped
down keeping his arms as far outstretched as possible.
Finally his toe touched something solid. He ventured
an inch farther at the risk of losing his balance.
He found a more secure footing and, taking a chance,
rested his full weight. The base was firm and he
drew down the other foot. He was on a wider path
than that above. He paused here for the effort had
made his breath come short. It was more the mental
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
than the physical strain which had weakened him.
It was nerve-racking work. The dark and the silence
oppressed him. There was almost a tomb-like effect
in this slit of the earth where man had not been for
centuries. Once he had ventured to shout to Stubbs
but his voice had sounded so muffled and the effort
had produced in him such a panicky feeling that he
did not try it again.</p>
<p>Once more he shuffled forward and once more his
foot dangled over nothing. But he had gained more
confidence now and lowered it to find another firm
base. Two more steps came after this, and then the
path proceeded on the level once more. He had gone
some forty paces on this last lap when he was brought
up against a face of solid rock. He moved his hands
over it as far as possible in every direction, but he
could not detect any boundaries. It appeared to be
a part of the cliff itself. But once more he recalled
the warning, &#8220;The seeming is not always the true.&#8221;
Then he tried to recall the details of the directions.
His map was about his neck but he was in such a
position that it would be hazardous to attempt to
reach it. In spite of the many times he had read
it, he could not now remember a word. The more he
tried, the more confused he became.</p>
<p>After all, he had gone farther than he had intended.
The thought of returning came as a relief. The next
time he would have more confidence and could proceed
with less of a strain. And so, step by step, he began
to retrace the path. He was forced to keep his cheek
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
almost flat to the rock. The dry dust sifted into his
nostrils and peppered his eyes so that he was beginning
to suffer acutely from the inflammation. His
arms, too, began to pain him as he had been unable to
relieve them at all from their awkward position. The
last fifty feet were accomplished in an agony that left
him almost too weak to raise his voice. But he braced
himself and shouted. He received no response. He
lifted his head and reached up an aching arm for the
sleeve which he had left dangling over the cliff. It
was not there. With a sinking heart he realized that
something must have happened to Stubbs. The coats
had probably fallen into the chasm below.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3><i>The Hidden Cave</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">In</span> the face of this new emergency Wilson, as a
real man will, quickly regained control of himself.
Some power within forced his aching body to
its needs. The first shock had been similar to that
which a diver feels when receiving no response to a
tug upon the life line. He felt like a unit suddenly
hurled against the universe. Every possible human
help was removed, bringing him face to face with
basic forces. His brain cleared, his swollen and inflamed
eyes came to their own, and his aching arms
recovered their strength. The fresh shock had thrown
these manifestations so far into the background of
his consciousness that they were unable to assert themselves.</p>
<p>Stubbs was gone. It was possible, of course, that
he lay dead up there within six feet of where Wilson
stood,&ndash;&ndash;dead, perhaps, with a knife in his back. But
this did not suggest itself so strongly as did the probability
that he had been seized and carried off. The
Priest, who was undoubtably back of this, would
not kill him at once. There was little need of that
and he would find him more useful alive than dead.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
If there had been a fight&ndash;&ndash;if Stubbs had been given
a chance&ndash;&ndash;then, of course, the Priest would have
struck hard and decisively. If he had been carried
away uninjured, Stubbs would find his way back here.
Of that he was sure. The man was strong, resourceful,
and would use his last ounce of strength to relieve
his partner.</p>
<p>Wilson was in a veritable rat trap. One wall of
the cliff projected over his head and the other slanted
at such an angle that it was impossible to cling to its
smooth surface. And so, although within such a short
distance of the top, he was as effectively imprisoned as
though he were at the bottom of the chasm. There
were just two things possible for him to do; wait
where he was on the chance that Stubbs might return,
or attempt to trace his way further and reach the cave.
If he waited, the dark might catch him there and so
he would be forced to remain standing until morning.
He hadn&#8217;t the strength left for that. The other
course would also be a bitter struggle to the last remaining
spark of energy and might leave him face to
face with another blank wall. However, that seemed
to offer the bigger chance and would bring death, if
death must be, more quickly.</p>
<p>He loosened the map from about his throat and,
unrolling it, examined it through his smarting eyes.
The directions took him almost step by step to the
big rock which had barred further progress. He
scanned the words which followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The path is locked,&#8221; it read, &#8220;but it opens to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
faithful&ndash;&ndash;to children of the Gilded One. Twelve
hands&#8217; breadth from the bottom and close to the wall lies
the sign. A strong man pressing steadily and with faith
against this spot will find the path opened to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twelve hands&#8217; breadth from the bottom and close to
the wall. But supposing that referred to some real
door which had since been blotted out by falling rock&ndash;&ndash;by
a later avalanche of which this barrier was a
relic? There was but one way to find out and he
must decide quickly. Also, he must memorize the
other directions, for he would be unable to consult his
map in the darkness of the lower chasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty strides on. If the foot stumbles here, the
fall is long. To the left ten paces, and then the
faithful come to the warmth of the living sun again.
The door stands before. Enter ye who are of the Sun;
pause if ye be bearded man or unclean.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twelve handbreadths up and close to the wall;
thirty paces on, then ten; so an opening of some sort appeared
and near it, the cave. The cave&ndash;&ndash;it lost its
meaning as a treasure house. It was a place to relieve
the ache which was creeping back to his arms; which
would soothe his straining legs. It was a place to lie
down in&ndash;&ndash;this hole, hiding pretty jewels and gold plate.</p>
<p>He raised his voice in a final call to Stubbs. It
was like calling against a wall; his muffled voice was
thrown back in his face. With a start he saw that the
light about him was fading. He studied his map for
the last time to make sure he had made no mistake,
and, folding it, adjusted it once more about his neck.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></div>
<p>It was the same laboriously slow process all over
again. He shuffled one foot ahead, moved his body
squat against the wall, and followed with the other
foot. Each time he moved the bitter dust sifted down
until it checked his breathing and burned his throat.
He had learned to keep his eyes fast closed, but it
was a constant effort, for this increased the feeling of
dizziness. Always there was a power at his back which
drew him out as though he were responding to some
powerful magnet. This and the temptation to loosen
the tight cords back of his knees&ndash;&ndash;to just let go and
sink into relaxation&ndash;&ndash;kept him at a more severe
strain than did the actual physical effort.</p>
<p>But more than gold was at stake now,&ndash;&ndash;more than
jewels, though they sparkled like stars. The prize
for steady legs and unflinching nerves was a respite
from Death. If he reached the cave, he would have
several days at least before him. Neither thirst nor
hunger, fierce masters though they are, can work their
will except by slow process. Against them Stubbs
would be racing and he had faith in this man.</p>
<p>He did not fear Death itself. In thinking of the
end, the bitter thing it meant to him was the taking
off of her. And every day meant one day more of her&ndash;&ndash;another
chance of finding her and getting her back
to God&#8217;s country and the life which awaited them
there. It <i>did</i> wait for them; in coming here they had
left the true course of their life, but it remained for
them to take it up when once they should make the
beaten tracks again. Now he was trembling along the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
ragged edge of losing it all&ndash;&ndash;all that lay behind and
all that lay before. But if this was to be so, why
had he ever seen that face in the misty dark? why
had he come upon her the second and the third
time? why had Chance brought him to her across
ten thousand miles of sea? why had it brought him
here? Why at the beginning could he not have
forgotten her as one forgets those who flit into one&#8217;s
life and out again? He did not believe in a jesting
God.</p>
<p>One foot forward, the body flat against the wall, a
little choke from the dust, then the other foot after.
A pause to catch the breath, then&ndash;&ndash;one foot forward,
the body flat against the wall, a little choke from the
dust, then the other foot after. Also he must pause
to remember that it was twelve hands up, close to the
wall, thirty paces on, then ten.</p>
<p>Odd things flash through a mind long at a tension.
In the midst of his suffering he found time to smile
at the thought that life had reduced itself to such a
formula. A single error in this sing-song, such as ten
hands up instead of twelve,&ndash;&ndash;<i>was</i> it ten or twelve?
Ten hands up and close to the wall&ndash;&ndash;twelve hands up
and close to the wall&ndash;&ndash;they sounded alike. Each
fell equally well into the rhythm of his song. He
stopped in the grip of a new fear. He had forgotten,
and, trying to recall the rest, he found he had forgotten
that too. His mind was a jumble so that now he did
not dare to put out his right foot at all without first
feeling with his toe a little beyond.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></div>
<p>But this passed soon, and his thoughts returned to
her, which steadied him instantly. So he came safely
to the single step down and accomplished this. Then
the other and accomplished that. At the end of a few
paces farther he faced the great rock. It had become
dark down here now,&ndash;&ndash;so dark that he could not see
six inches ahead. His foot had come against the rock,
and then he had felt up with his hands. He found it
impossible to stoop sufficiently accurately to measure
from the bottom. There was nothing for it but to guess&ndash;&ndash;to
try again and again until either it gave or he
proved that it would not give.</p>
<p>He placed his hand upon the rock at about the height
of his chest and threw his weight forward. It was as
though he were trying to push the mountain itself to
one side. He tried above, below, to the right, to the
left without result. Nothing discouraged, he began
again, starting from as low as he could reach and
pressing with all his strength at intervals of a few
inches. Suddenly, like a door opened from within,
the rock toppled to the right where it hung balanced
over the precipice, leaving an opening two feet wide.
It would have been a tight squeeze for Stubbs, but
Wilson easily jammed through. He saw that the path
continued at a slightly downward slope.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty paces on and ten to the left.&#8221;</p>
<p>He repeated the words parrot fashion and his feet
obeyed the instructions automatically. The thirty
paces ended so near the edge of crumbling rock that
it fell away beneath his toe leaving some two inches
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
over nothing. Had a man walked here without directions,
he certainly would have taken this last step and
been hurled into the space below. It was pitch dark
where he stood. He felt along the wall for the opening
which should take him to the left ten paces. The
wall, the path, the depth below the path were all one
save to touch alone. It was as though he himself had
been deadened to every sense but this. During the
last few minutes his brain, too, had dulled so that all
he now grasped of the great happy world outside was
a vague memory of blue sky before which a shadowy
figure danced like a will-o&#8217;-the-wisp. But still propelled
by the last instinct to leave man before the soul,
he put one foot ahead of him, pressed his body flat to
the wall, and drew the other after. As he proceeded
thus, counting the steps he took, he became aware that
the air was fresher. Ahead, he saw an opening which
was a little less dark than this which stifled him. It
was light, though he saw it only faintly through
blurred eyes. It was a gray slit coming together at the
top. He groped his way almost to the edge and then
to the left he saw a second opening&ndash;&ndash;an opening
into another dark. It was the cave. He staggered
the few remaining feet and fell prone upon its granite
floor.</p>
<p>How long he remained so he could not tell. He was
not wholly unconscious, but in a state so bordering
upon it that he realized nothing but the ecstatic relief
which came to his aching body. Still he was able to
realize that. Also he knew that he had reached his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
journey&#8217;s end, so far as anything more he could do was
concerned. He would wait&ndash;&ndash;wait as long as possible&ndash;&ndash;cling
to the very last second of life. He must do
that for her. That was all that was left.</p>
<p>His slowly fading senses flickered back. He roused
himself and sat up. In the gloom back of him he made
out nothing: the opening was becoming obliterated
by the dark without, so that he felt as though in a
sealed box&ndash;&ndash;a coffin almost. He felt an impulse to
shout, but his dry lips choked this back. He could not
sit still. He must act in some way. He rose to his
hands and knees and began to grope about without any
definite object. There was something uncanny in the
thought that this silence had not been broken for centuries.
He thought of it as his toes scraped along the
granite behind him. Once when he put out his hands
near the cave opening, they fell upon what felt like
cloth. Something gave before his touch with a dry
rattle as of bones. He drew back with the morbid
thought that they really <i>were</i> bones. Perhaps some
other poor devil had made his way here and died.</p>
<p>He felt a craving, greater at first even than his
thirst, for light. If only the moon came in here somewhere;
if only he could find wood to make a fire. He
had a few matches, but these he must keep for something
more important than catering to a fear. He
turned back to the cave mouth, pressing forward this
time to the very edge. He saw opposite him another
sheer face of rock which came in parallel to this in
which he was imprisoned. His eyes fell below to a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
measureless drop. But the moon was shining and
found its way down into these depths. With his eyes
still down he bathed in this. Then, with returning
strength, he turned to the left and his heart came into
his throat. There was still more light; but, greater
joy than this, he caught sight far below him of a pool
of liquid purple. The cold, unshimmering rays of
the moon played upon it in silver paths. It was the
lake&ndash;&ndash;the lake upon whose borders it was possible
she stood at that very moment, perhaps looking up at
these cliffs. It looked such a gentle thing&ndash;&ndash;this lake.
Within its calm waters another moon shone and about
its edges a fringe of dark where the trees threw their
shadows. He thrust his body out as far as possible
to see more of it. The light and the color were as balm
to his eyes. But it brought back another fever; how
he would like to thrust his hot head into its depths and
drink, drink, drink! The idea pressed in upon him so
strongly, with such insane persistence, that he felt as
though if he got very near the edge and took a firm
grip with his toes, he could reach the water in a jump.
It was worth trying. If he took a long breath,
and got just the right balance&ndash;&ndash;he found himself
actually crouching. He fell back from this danger,
but he couldn&#8217;t escape his thirst. He must find
water. The dry dust had sifted into his throat&ndash;&ndash;his
lungs.</p>
<p>His thoughts now centered on nothing else but this.
Water stood for everything in the world&ndash;&ndash;for the
world itself, because it meant life. Water&ndash;&ndash;water&ndash;&ndash;nothing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
else could quench the fever which tore at his
throat like a thing with a million sharp claws&ndash;&ndash;nothing
else could clear his brain&ndash;&ndash;nothing else put the
strength back into his legs.</p>
<p>Back into the cave he pressed&ndash;&ndash;back into the unknown
dark. The flinty sides were cool. He stopped
to press his cheeks against them, then licked them with
his dry tongue. Back&ndash;&ndash;back away from the temptation
to jump, he staggered. Another step, for all he
knew, might plunge him into some dark well; but even
so, it wouldn&#8217;t matter much. There might be water
at the bottom. Now and then he paused to listen, for
it seemed to him he caught the musical tinkling of
dripping water. He pictured a crystal stream such
as that in which when a boy he used to fish for trout,
tinkling over the clean rock surface,&ndash;&ndash;a sparkling,
fairy waterfall where at the bottom he might scoop
up icy handfuls.</p>
<p>He tried to pierce the dark to where this sound
seemed to be. He struck one of his precious matches.
The flame which he held before him was repeated a
thousand times, in a shining pool to the left. With
a throaty, animal-like cry, he threw himself forward
and plunged his hands into the pool. They met a cutting
surface of a hundred little stones. He groped all
around; nothing but these little stones. He grabbed
a handful of them and struck another match. This
was no pool of water&ndash;&ndash;this was not a crystal spring&ndash;&ndash;it
was nothing but a little pile of diamonds. In a rage
he flung them from him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<p>Jewels&ndash;&ndash;jewels when he wanted water! Baubles
of stone when he thirsted! Surely the gods here who
guarded these vanities must be laughing. If each of
these crystals had only been a drop of that crystal which
gives life and surcease to burning throats,&ndash;&ndash;if only
these bits could resolve themselves into that precious
thing which they mocked with their clearness!</p>
<p>Maddened by the visions these things had summoned,
he staggered back to the opening. At least he
must have air&ndash;&ndash;big, cooling draughts of air. It was
the one thing which was left to him. He would bathe
in it and drink it into his hot lungs. He moved on his
hands and knees with his head dropped low between
them like a wounded animal. It was almost as though
he had become a child once more&ndash;&ndash;life had become
now so elemental. Of all the things this big world furnished,
he wanted now but that one thing which it
furnishes in such abundance. Just water&ndash;&ndash;nothing
else. Water of which there were lakes full and rivers
full; water which thundered by the ton over crags;
water which flooded down over all the earth. And
this, the freest of all things, was taken from him
while that for which men cut one another&#8217;s throats
was flung in his face. Yes, he had become just a
child once more,&ndash;&ndash;a child mouthing for the breast
of Nature.</p>
<p>When he reached the opening he dropped flat with
his head over the chasm. His blurred eyes could still
see one thing&ndash;&ndash;the big, cool lake where the moon
laughed back at herself,&ndash;&ndash;the big cool lake where the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
water bathed the shores,&ndash;&ndash;the big cool lake where
Jo slept.</p>
<p>Jo&ndash;&ndash;love&ndash;&ndash;life&ndash;&ndash;these were just below him.
And behind him, within reach of his weak fingers, lay
a useless half billion in precious stones. So he fought
for life in the center of the web.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3><i>The Taste of Rope</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">Stubbs</span> was lying flat upon his chest staring
anxiously down into the fissure where Wilson
had disappeared when suddenly he felt a weight upon
his back and another upon each of his outstretched
arms. In spite of this, he reached his knees, but the
powerful brown men still clung. He shook himself as
a mad bull does at the sting of the darts. It was just
as useless. In another minute he was thrown again,
and in another, bound hand and foot with a stout
grass rope. Without a word, as though he were a slain
deer, he was lifted to their shoulders and ignominiously
carted down the mountain side. It was all so
quickly done that he blinked back at the sun in a daze
as though awaking from some evil dream. But his
uncomfortable position soon assured him that it was
a reality and he settled into a sullen rage. He had
been captured as easily as a drunken sailor is
shanghaied.</p>
<p>They never paused until they lowered him like a
bundle of hay within a dozen feet of where he had
tethered his burros. Instantly he heard a familiar
voice jabbering with his captors. In a few minutes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
the Priest himself stepped before him and studied him
curiously as he rolled a cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the other?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Find him,&#8221; growled Stubbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Either I or the Golden One will find him,&ndash;&ndash;that
is certain. There is but one pass over the mountain,&#8221;
he added in explanation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe. What d&#8217; ye want of us, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Priest flicked the ashes from his cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did <i>you</i> want&ndash;&ndash;by the hut yonder? Your
course lay another way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t a free man a right up there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the shrine of the Golden One.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t marked sech.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have learned&ndash;&ndash;now. It is better in a
strange country to learn such things before than afterwards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The same to you&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;bout strange people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Priest smoked idly a few minutes longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the other?&#8221; he asked again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask your Golden Man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He knows only the dead. Shall I wait?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jus&#8217; as you damned please,&#8221; growled Stubbs.</p>
<p>He saw no use in trying to pacify this devil. Even
if he had seen a hope, it would have gone too much
against him to attempt it. He felt the same contempt
for him that he would of a mutinous sailor; he
was just bad,&ndash;&ndash;to be beaten by force and nothing
else.</p>
<p>The yellow teeth showed between the thin lips.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The bearded men are like kings until&ndash;&ndash;they lie
prostrate like slaves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stubbs did not answer. His thoughts flew back to
Wilson. He pictured his return to find his partner
gone. Would he be able to climb out of that ill-fated
hole without aid? It was possible, but if he succeeded,
he might fall into worse hands. At any cost he must
turn suspicion aside from that particular spot. Apparently
it had as yet no especial significance, if its
existence were known at all, to the natives.</p>
<p>&#8220;My partner,&#8221; said Stubbs, deliberately, &#8220;has gone
to find the girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you waited for him&ndash;&ndash;up there in the sun?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He had better have remained with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There would have been some dead niggers if he
had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My friend,&#8221; said the Priest, &#8220;before morning I
shall know if you have told the truth this time. In
the meanwhile I shall leave you in the company of my
children. I hope you will sleep well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;D&#8217; ye mean to keep me tied like this till morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see no other way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then damn your eyes if&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But he bit off the phrase and closed his eyes against
the grinning face before him. As a matter of fact, he
had made a discovery which brought with it a ray of
hope. He found that with an effort he was able to
bring his teeth against the rope where it passed over
his shoulder. His hands were tied behind his back,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
but with the slack he would gain after gnawing through
the rope, he would be able to loosen them. They had
taken his revolver, but they had overlooked the hunting
knife he always carried within his shirt suspended
from his neck&ndash;&ndash;a precaution which had proved useful
to him before. The very thing he now hoped for was
that they would leave him as he was.</p>
<p>The Priest departed and did not appear again. The
three brown men settled down on their haunches and
fell into that state of Indian lethargy which they were
able to maintain for days, every sense resting but still
alert. With their knees drawn up to their chins they
chewed their coca leaves and stared at their toes, immovable
as images. Stubbs looked them over; they
did not appear to be strong men. Their arms and legs
were rounded like those of women, and their chests
were thin. He wondered now why he had not been
able to shake them off.</p>
<p>Stubbs settled back to wait, but every now and then
he deliberately tossed, turning from his back to his side
and again to his back. He had two objects in mind;
to keep the watchmen alert so that the strain would
tell eventually in dulled senses, and to throw them off
their guard when the time came that the movements
really meant something. But they never even looked
up; never shifted their positions. Each had by his
side a two-edged sword, but neither revolver nor rifle.
His own Winchester still lay in the grass near the hut,
if they had not stolen it.</p>
<p>In this way several hours passed before he made the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
first move towards escape. They gave him neither
water nor nourishment. So he waited until dark.
Then he turned his head until his teeth rested upon
the rope. He remained in this position without moving
for ten minutes and then slowly, carefully began to
nibble. The rope was finely knit and as tough as raw
hide. At the end of a half hour he had scarcely made
any impression at all upon it. At the end of an hour
he had started several strands. The wiry threads
irritated his lips and tongue so that they soon began
to bleed, but this in turn softened the rope a trifle.
The three brown men never stirred. The stars looked
down impartially upon the four; also upon the girl
by the lake and the man in the cave. It was all one
to them.</p>
<p>He gnawed as steadily and as patiently as a rat.
Each nibble soon became torture, but he never ceased
save to toss a bit that the guards might not get suspicious.
The dark soon blurred their outlines, but
he had fixed their positions in his mind so that he
could have reached them with his eyes shut. At the
end of the third hour he had made his way half through
the rope. It took him two hours more to weaken one
half of the remainder. The pain was becoming unendurable.
He quivered from head to foot each time
he moved his jaw, for his lips were torn to the quick.
His tongue was shredded; his chest damp with blood.
Finally he ceased. Then carefully, very carefully,
threw back his shoulders so as to bring a strain to the
rope. He felt it pull apart, and sank to rest a bit.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></div>
<p>Apparently he lay without moving. The brown men
were like dead men. But inch by inch he had drawn
the rope slack until he was able to unwind it from his
wrists. Then by half inches he moved his hands free,
slipping one of them from behind him to his side. It
seemed to him as though Nature herself had paused
to watch and listen. He turned now with his free hand
beneath him. Slowly his fingers crept towards his
chest, grasped the sheath, freed the blade, and then
back to his side once more. He turned to his back,
his hand behind him, his fingers grasping the horn
handle.</p>
<p>His feet were still bound, but he figured that he
could raise himself to a sitting posture and sever these
with a single slash at the moment he sprang. But he
must be quick&ndash;&ndash;must be strong&ndash;&ndash;must be calm. To
this end he stretched himself upon his back and waited.
If he were able to kill the first man with a single blow,
he felt he would stand more than an equal chance with
the two others. He was an adept in the use of the
knife.</p>
<p>In a flash he was upright; in another he had cut
through the rope on his ankles. He leaped forward,
striking deep as his feet touched the earth. The knife
sank to the hilt in the brown body. One of the others
was reaching for his sword as Stubbs struck home
again. But as he drew out his knife, the third was
rushing for him with his long sword in his hands. He
never reached him. With the skill of long experience,
Stubbs threw his knife with the speed of an arrow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
from a bow. It struck the man just above the heart
and he stumbled over his own feet. Stubbs melted
into the shadow of the trees.</p>
<p>Once out of sight of the scene of this struggle, he
stopped and listened. If this were all of them, there
were several things he would get before he returned
to the heights. A light breeze rustled the heavy tops
above him, but otherwise the world seemed sound
asleep. There was not the cracking of a twig&ndash;&ndash;not
the movement of a shadow. He ventured back. The
three forms, save that they had settled into awkward
positions, looked very much as they had a few minutes
ago when they had stood between him and freedom.
He passed them, stopping to recover his knife, and
then moved on to where he had hidden the provisions.
He took a rope, a can of beef, some crackers, and a
small quantity of coca leaves. Then he went to the
spring nearby and soothed his sore throat and mouth
with water. He also filled a quart flask which he tied
behind him. Returning to the cach&eacute;, he covered it up
again and, placing a roll of the coca leaves beneath
his tongue, started on the ascent.</p>
<p>The dawn was just appearing in a flush of pink
when he reached the top. <a name="P271"></a>A reconnaissance of the rocks
around the hut and at the entrance to the crevice convinced
him that no guards had been left here. Evidently
the Priest had not thought their capture of
supreme importance. It was more an act of precaution
than anything else.</p>
<p>He felt more refreshed at the top of the peak than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
he had at the bottom and, wondering at this, it suddenly
occurred to him that this was the effect of the
coca leaves. He had heard in Bogova that the natives
under its influence were able to endure incredible
hardships without other nourishment of any kind. He
took a larger mouthful. At any rate, they acted as
balm upon his tongue and macerated lips. He felt
no inclination to rest. Even had he felt fatigue, his
anxiety over Wilson would have forbidden further
delay.</p>
<p>He fastened one end of his rope securely about a
point of rock and then sat down to study the map once
more. He realized that he would need the help of
every detail of these directions. Already he had committed
them to memory,&ndash;&ndash;he was calmer than Wilson
about it and so had remembered them better,&ndash;&ndash;but
he went over them once more. There was more than
treasure at stake this time.</p>
<p>He lowered himself into the crevice which had
swallowed up his companion, with almost a sense of
relief at being for the moment beyond the power of the
Priest. He was tempted to cut the rope behind him,
but a brief examination convinced him that this would
be foolhardy. He still had sufficient left for an emergency&ndash;&ndash;in
case the rope was drawn up from above.
Two men should stand a better chance of getting out
of here than would a single man.</p>
<p>At the end of the first ten feet along the narrow path
Stubbs felt much less confident than at the start that
Wilson was alive. And he worked his way along the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
dangerous course with increasing fear. It was with
a gasp of relief that he finally saw the opening ahead
of him which marked the end. He paused to shout.
He received no reply. He called his comrade&#8217;s name
again. The dark walls about him caught his voice and
imprisoned it.</p>
<p>Taking new risks, he pushed ahead. To the left he
saw the cave mouth. He stopped once more, half
fearing what he should find, and ran the remaining
steps. At the entrance to the cave itself he stumbled
over a prostrate body.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3><i>The Spider Snaps</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">Stooping,</span> Stubbs ran his hand down the length
of Wilson&#8217;s arm and felt for his pulse. He
caught a weak but steady beat. Prying open his
mouth, he poured a large mouthful of water down the
dry throat. Wilson quickly revived and begged for
more.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, m&#8217; son, this&#8217;ll do fer now. You&#8217;ll need it
worse later on. An&#8217; I&#8217;m darned glad to see yer again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&ndash;&ndash;how long have I been here, Stubbs?&#8221;
panted Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nigh twenty-four hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A day&ndash;&ndash;a whole day wasted!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; another cross agin yer fren&#8217; the Priest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Th&#8217; same.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave Wilson a little food and a wisp of the coca
leaves to chew and briefly told him what he had just
been through. He concluded with a wave of his hand
about him.</p>
<p>&#8220;So here we are at last, an&#8217; a crew of savages
waitin&#8217; fer us at the top, which makes a fine and
fittin&#8217; end fer any v&#8217;yage upon which I embarks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Water&ndash;&ndash;give me more water.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stubbs rested the bottle to the man&#8217;s lips a moment
and then had to fight with him to get it away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Stubbs, &#8220;if ye&#8217;ve gut th&#8217; breath, tell
me, has ye explored at all?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson shook his head. He answered vaguely, his
thoughts still upon the one thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;A day wasted and the Priest on his way! He
said within a day, didn&#8217;t he, Stubbs? Lord! we&#8217;ve
got to get out of here; we&#8217;ve got to get to her. He&#8217;ll
kill them both&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson struggled to his feet and plunged towards
the exit to the cave. Stubbs was upon him in a second
and bore him down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gawd, man, h&#8217;ain&#8217;t yer any sense left at all?&#8221;</p>
<p>A second later he repented his sharp speech, and
added,</p>
<p>&#8220;There, lay still a moment, lad. I knows how yer
feel, but we might&#8217;s well look aroun&#8217; an&#8217; find out how
much bigger damned fools we are. Ye&#8217;ve gotter git
yer strength before ye can move back over that course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The treasure is there,&#8221; whispered Wilson; &#8220;but,
Stubbs, I want more water&ndash;&ndash;buckets of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Diamonds&ndash;&ndash;diamonds, and not a drop of water.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stubbs did not believe it. He took it to be the
hallucination of a man weak with thirst. But one thing
was settled in his mind: if the cave were empty, he
wouldn&#8217;t waste any more time here. Danger was
increasing with every minute. He pawed his way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
into the rear of the cave and had not gone ten feet
before he stumbled over the same pile Wilson had
found. He seized a handful of the stones and made
his way back to the light.</p>
<p>The jewels sparkled in his rough palm like chips
from the stars themselves. They were of all sizes from
a beechnut to a pecan. Even roughly cut and polished
as they were, they still flashed back their rainbow hues
with pointed brilliancy. He picked out a large yellow
diamond which even in this dim light glowed like
molten gold in a fog; another which imprisoned the
purple of the night sky; and another tinged with the
faint crimson of an afterglow. Jumbled together in
his hand, they were a scintillating pile of tiny, living
stars, their rays fencing in a dazzling play of light.
Even to Stubbs, who knew nothing of the stones, they
were so fascinating that he turned them over and over
with his finger to watch their twinkling iridescence.</p>
<p>Just those he held there now were such as a lapidary
would spend his life willingly in the getting.
If not another stone were found in the cave, these
alone represented a fortune worthy of the expedition.
Each stone as it stood was worth probably from three to
eight hundred dollars, and some of the larger would
run into the thousands. It was difficult to realize
their full value here where they counted for so little,&ndash;&ndash;no
more than the rays of the stars themselves,&ndash;&ndash;here
where so many others lay in a heap like broken
glass. Vaguely Stubbs grasped the fact that he had
in his possession the worth of many good ships and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
freedom for the rest of his life. Yet he thrilled less
with this thought than he did with the sheer joy of
discovery. A man will cherish a dime he picks up
on the street more than he does a five-dollar bill in his
pocket. It was this spirit of treasure-trove that got
into his blood, sending a tingle of new life through
his veins. He tried to rouse Wilson to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come here, man,&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Come here and
see what we&#8217;ve got. God! there&#8217;s millions in this
cave!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Wilson lifted his head indifferently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t give a damn,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t seen &#8217;em sparkle&ndash;&ndash;you haven&#8217;t gut
it inter yer head! Ye&#8217;re rich&ndash;&ndash;richer than Danbury!&#8221;</p>
<p>He hurried back to where Wilson sat and thrust the
jewels before his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;D&#8217; ye see &#8217;em?&#8221; he cried excitedly. &#8220;Bigger &#8217;n
yer thumb?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a second his old-time suspicion and doubt
returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;But maybe,&#8221; he added sorrowfully, &#8220;maybe
they&#8217;re jus&#8217; glass. Jus&#8217; my luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless he believed sufficiently in them to
return to the quest. He struck match after match,
wandering farther and farther into the darkness,
hoping to find something with which he could make
light enough to see around him. He gave a little cry
of joy as he came upon an old-time altar light&ndash;&ndash;a
platter of oil containing a crude wick. He lighted this.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
The flame sputtered feebly, died down, then revived
to a big, steady flame. With his arms at his side, his
mouth wide open, he gaped at what the light revealed.</p>
<p>The cave was not large; this lamp disclosed its
boundaries. It also disclosed other things, chief of
which was a leering idol some three feet tall which
squatted, cross-legged, with one hand extended. This
hand held a polished diamond larger than a walnut.
The eyes were of ruby which, catching the light, burned
with ghoul-like ferocity, while the mouth grinned,&ndash;&ndash;grinned
with a smile which strangely resembled that
of the Priest. The image was of gold. To the right
and left, piled up as though they had been hastily
thrown together, was a jumble of vases, bowls, plates,
shields, all of beaten gold. They made a heap some
four feet high, and from six to eight feet broad at the
base. Strewn about the foot of this were many little
leather bags tied at the top with dried sinews.</p>
<p>Minute after minute Stubbs stared at this sight in
silence. There was more gold here than he thought
existed in the world,&ndash;&ndash;so much that it lost its
value. Here was enough almost to load down a ship.
If he could crowd a few hundred dollars into a bag
small enough to stuff into his pocket, this must run up
into the millions. He had always spoken of a man
worth a million with a certain amount of awe and
doubt; and here lay ten, perhaps fifty, times that
amount. At the end of forty years of sailing the seas
he had saved a little over three thousand dollars
against the days he should be old and feeble. Three
thousand dollars! Two or three of those stones he
had slipped into his pocket,&ndash;&ndash;four or five of these
plates of which there were hundreds!</p>

<i>Minute after minute, Stubbs stared at this sight in silence.</i><br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></div>
<p>He moved forward and tried to lift one of the big
vases of crudely beaten gold. With his full weight
against it, he could scarcely move it. Farther on there
was a bar of gold heavier than three men could carry.
To the left of this there was a pile of golden shields
studded with jewels, strange ornaments, and heavy
plates. Back of this he caught a glimpse of still other
ingots of gold in the shadows.</p>
<p>And always the big image held extended towards
him with a cynical leer the big, polished diamond
which seemed rather to give out light from within
itself than to reflect the altar flames. It blazed with
a brilliancy that he had never seen equalled save by
the stars on faultless winter nights.</p>
<p>He was too dumbfounded at first to take it all in.
He turned about in a circle, resting his eyes again
upon one thing after another, and then raised his hand
and looked at that to make sure that he was seeing
correctly&ndash;&ndash;was not the victim of some strange illusion.
Yes, his eyes were all right; he saw his calloused,
big-jointed hand&ndash;&ndash;the hand which had labored
so long for a millionth part of what he now saw here.
The gold and the jewels were within arms&#8217; reach of
him&ndash;&ndash;there was no longer any doubt about that.
His luck must have turned.</p>
<p>He moved back to where Wilson still lay sprawled
out upon his back only half conscious of his surroundings.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
He tried to speak calmly, but he blurted
out,</p>
<p>&#8220;Gawd, man, there&#8217;s tons of it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson did not move or speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shiploads of it. Man! Man! wake up an&#8217; see
what&#8217;s afore yer eyes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Stubbs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gold! Gold! Gold! The stuff thet outside here
yer haster fight ter git a pinch of,&ndash;&ndash;the stuff I&#8217;ve
sailed aroun&#8217; the worl&#8217; ter git a handful of; the stuff
ye&#8217;ve come so far on the bare chance of seein&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s here, then? The treasure is here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More than ever ye dreamed of. Small wonder
that Sorez was willin&#8217; ter take chances agin the Priest
if he knew of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson brushed his hand over his eyes. The name
roused him. This meant getting back to Sorez&ndash;&ndash;getting
back to him with proof of the treasure and so
releasing the girl. He made his feet and stood a
moment with his hand upon Stubbs&#8217; shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad, Stubbs,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Now&ndash;&ndash;now
let&#8217;s get back to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye, we&#8217;ll get back, but first we&#8217;ve got ter figger
out some way for gittin&#8217; of this stuff out.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, they learned that they were
really facing something of a problem. It was a marvel
how ever these things were got down here, but it would
be a still greater task to get them out again. Twenty
fanatical worshipers of the Sun God gave their lives
to bearing these priceless offerings from the lake to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
this cave with the incentive of winning everlasting
happiness. It was a different problem for two tired
and nerve-exhausted men to retrace their steps.</p>
<p>Even if it were possible to get the treasure to the
surface, it would need a small army of men and burros
to carry it over the mountains to civilization, and
another small army to defend it while on the journey.
It would be almost equally impossible, probably,
for them ever again to reach this cave. If they were
successful in getting out of this country alive now
that the Priest was roused and the natives incensed
over the death of their fellows, it certainly would
be sure death ever to return. As for organizing a
company either at Bogova or in America for the purpose
of removing the treasure, Stubbs had the usual
independent man&#8217;s distrust of such means. It became
clearer to him every minute that the only share of
this hoard of which they ever could be sure was what
they might now take out with them. This practically
eliminated the vast store of golden implements, for it
was impossible to carry even the smallest of them on
their shoulders over so rough and dangerous a trail as
this. It began to look as though they had reached this
treasure at length merely to be tantalized by it. The
very thought was like a nightmare.</p>
<p>His eyes fell upon the small leather bags. Stooping, he
picked up one of them, untied it and poured its contents
upon the cave floor; a flashing stream of rubies rippled
out and glowed at his feet in a tiny, blood-red heap.
And there were a dozen more of these bags in sight!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Lord, man!&#8221; he exclaimed below his breath, &#8220;it&#8217;s
&#8217;nuff to make yer b&#8217;lieve ye&#8217;re dreamin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The jewels gave him fresh courage. Here, at any
rate, was a fortune which was within their present
reach. They could carry these things back with them
even though they were forced to leave the bulk of the
treasure in its heavier form. A single one of these
little leather bags was sufficient to repay them for their
trouble if they didn&#8217;t get anything else. But one
thing was sure&ndash;&ndash;their single chance of escaping with
even these was to start at once. The Priest would
undoubtedly have the whole region up in arms before
dark, and, if he didn&#8217;t find them before, would have
a force at the mountain pass. It went against his
grain to abandon such riches as these, but life and
a few million was better than death with all the gold
in the world piled about your tomb.</p>
<p>To Wilson, who in the last few minutes had become
more himself, the treasure still meant just one thing&ndash;&ndash;the
opportunity of freeing Jo. With this evidence
he could return to Sorez and persuade him of the
futility of his search in the lake itself and induce him
to join his party and escape while there was time.
If he didn&#8217;t succeed in this, he would take the girl
even if he had to do so by force.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a case of grab and jump,&#8221; said Stubbs. &#8220;You
gather up the loose stones on the floor and I&#8217;ll collect
the bags. The sooner we gets to the top, th&#8217; better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stubbs took the altar light and made a careful
search of the bottom of the cave for jewels. These were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
the things which embodied in the smallest weight the
most value. It made him groan every time he passed
an ingot of gold or some massive vase which he knew
must run into the thousands, but at the end of ten
minutes he felt better; the stones alone were sufficient
to satisfy even the most avaricious. About the
base of the grinning idol they found fourteen leather
bags, each filled with gems. The loose diamonds which
had been roughly thrown into a small pile would fill
four bags more. Even Wilson became roused at sight
of these. He began to realize their value and the power
such wealth would give him. If the girl was still
alive, he now had the means of moving an army to her
aid. If she was still alive&ndash;&ndash;but the day was waning
and the Priest, now thoroughly aroused, doubtless
moving towards her intent upon wiping out every
stranger, man or woman, in the hills.</p>
<p>Stubbs was for going farther back into the cave and
exploring some of the recesses into which they had not
yet looked at all. But Wilson, with returning strength,
became impatient again. The coca leaves which he
had chewed constantly brought him new life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord! would you sell the girl for a few more
bags of jewels, Stubbs?&#8221; he burst out.</p>
<p>The latter straightened instantly and came nearer.
But before he had time to speak, Wilson apologized.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I know better, comrade, but I can&#8217;t wait any
longer to get to her. I&#8217;m five years older than I was
a day ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>The while they were gathering the little bags full of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
jewels, the big image in the corner smiled his smile
and offered them the big diamond in his hand; the
while they buckled the bags about their waists&ndash;&ndash;as
precious belts as ever men wore&ndash;&ndash;the image smiled
and offered; as they moved towards the mouth of the
cave it still insisted. Yet for some reason neither man
had felt like taking the stone. Stubbs felt a bit superstitious
about it, while Wilson felt enough reverence,
even for heathen gods, to refrain. But still it smiled
and offered. In the flickering flare of the altar light
the stone burned with increasing brilliancy. It was
as though it absorbed the flames and, adding new fuel,
flashed them forth again.</p>
<p>Wilson led the way out. Before they left the cave
Stubbs turned. He saw the image once again, and
once again the stone. The temptation was too great,
especially now that they were on the point of leaving&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
forever. He started back and Wilson tried
to check him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t, Stubbs. Those eyes look too ugly.
It is only the mouth that smiles and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye haven&#8217;t turned heathen yerself, have ye?&#8221; he
called back.</p>
<p>He stepped forward and clutched it. But the jewel
was fastened in some way although it seemed a bit
loose. He pulled strongly upon it and the next second
leaped back, warned in time by a suspicious rumbling
above his head. He looked down to see a slab of
granite weighing half a ton on the spot where he had
stood a moment before. It was an ingenious bit of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
mechanism arranged to protect the treasure; the jewel
had been attached by a stout cord which, when pulled,
loosed the weight above. Not only this, but it became
evident in a few seconds that it loosed also other forces&ndash;&ndash;whether
by design or chance, the two men never
determined. They had pressed back to the path outside
the cave, when they heard a rumble like distant
thunder, followed instantly by a grinding and crashing.
Before their eyes a large section of the cliff crashed
down over the cave itself and into the chasm below.
They didn&#8217;t wait to see what followed, but made their
way along the path as fast as they dared.</p>
<p>Neither man spoke again until a half hour later
after a journey that was like a passage through Hell,
they lay exhausted in the sunlight above the chasm.
The thunder of tumbling rock still pounded at their
ears.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3><i>Those in the Hut</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">In</span> an angle formed by two cliff sides, within a
stone&#8217;s throw of the lake of Guadiva, a native,
Flores by name, had built himself a hut. Here he
lived with his mate Lotta in a little Nirvana of his
own, content with his love and his task of tending
a flock of sheep which furnished them both with food
and clothing. Few came near this hut. The sky
above, the lake before, and the mountains round about
were all his, his and his alone even as was the love
of the dark-eyed woman near him. Within their
simple lives they had sounded the depths of despair
and reached the heights of bliss.</p>
<p>The woman Lotta was the daughter of a chieftain
of the tribe of Chibca, one whose ancestry went far
back into the history of the Golden One. Some of
them had been priests, some of them guards, and all
of them had fought hard for their god. But the father
of this girl incurred the displeasure of the Priest and
finally, not yielding to discipline, his wrath. The
stern autocrat of these tribes condemned him to extreme
punishment&ndash;&ndash;a fast of thirty days in the hut
upon the mountain top&ndash;&ndash;the hut of the Golden God.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
Cowed and frightened, the man, somewhat feeble with
sickness, bade good-bye to his daughter and climbed
the rugged path. Below, the girl waited day after
day until the strain became unbearable. She ventured,
knowing well what the penalty was, to visit him
with food. She found him groaning upon the stone
floor, eaten by fever and racked with pain. She
nursed him until her supplies were exhausted and
then came down for more, choosing a secret path which
she in her rambles as a girl had discovered. It was then
she heard whispered among the gossips news of a white
stranger with marvelous powers who was hiding in
the hut of a neighbor. It was just after the battle
with the men from the sea&ndash;&ndash;a battle terrible in its
ferocity. This man was one of the refugees from the
scattered army, sheltered at first for gold and later
because of the power he possessed of stopping pain.
A wounded native, member of the family which
sheltered him, had been brought in suffering agonies
and the stranger had healed him with the touch of a
tiny needle. Lotta heard these things and that night
found the stranger&#8217;s hiding place and begged him to
follow. He knew enough of the native language to
understand and&ndash;&ndash;to make his bargain. If she would
guide him to the mountain pass, he would follow.</p>
<p>The man was Sorez.</p>
<p>The next few hours were burned into Sorez&#8217; mind
forever. At her heels he had clawed his way up the
steep hillside expecting at every step a spear thrust
in his back. He tore his hands and knees, but, drawn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
on by a picture of the girl, moving shadow-like in the
moonlight ahead of him, he followed steadily after.
Pausing for breath once he saw the dark fringe of
trees below the lava slopes, the twinkle of the camp
fires, and over all the clear stars. But this region
here was a dead region. He felt as if he were moving
through some inferno, some ghastly haunt of moaning
specters, with the dark-faced girl guiding him like
some dead love. On they climbed in silence until his
head began to swim with the exertion and the rarefied
air. Suddenly the girl disappeared as though she had
dropped over a precipice. To the left he saw a small
path leading over a yawning chasm. She beckoned
and he felt his way along. Then they came upon a
tiny plateau upon which had been built a hut of rocks.</p>
<p>The scene within was terrible. Upon the stone floor
lay a brown-skinned skeleton with bulging eyes and
clawing fingers muttering incoherently. Sorez could do
nothing but administer a small injection of the soothing
drug, but this brought instant relief and with it a few
moments of sanity. The doctor had picked up a small
vocabulary and gathered from what the dying man
muttered that he, Sorez, a very much bruised and
weary mortal, was being mistaken for one from heaven.
A smile lighted the haggard face of the invalid and the
bony hands came together in prayer. The girl bent
over him and then drew back in horror. She met the
eyes of her father in some new-found wonder, gasping
for breath. Then she bent her ear once more. The
message, whatever it was, was repeated. Still, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
though half doubting, she moved to the rear of the hut
and pounded with a large rock against what was
apparently the naked face of the cliff in which the
hut was built. It swung in, revealing a sort of shrine.
Within this reposed a golden image. She turned her
eyes again upon her father and then without hesitation
took out the idol and handed it to Sorez.</p>
<p>&#8220;The God of Gods,&#8221; she whispered, bending low her
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want your god,&#8221; protested the doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must. He says it is for you to guard.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had taken it carelessly to humor the dying man.
And when the latter closed his eyes for all time, Sorez
remembered that the heathen image was still in his
possession. He started to return it to the shrine, but
the girl threw herself before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. The trust is yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, it would be a pleasant memento of an incident
that was anything but pleasant. He brought it down
the mountain side and put it beneath his blanket.</p>
<p>It was not until several days later that bit by bit he
came to a realization of that which he had so lightly
taken. The old man who brought his food whispered
the news through ashen lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Golden One is gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is the Golden One?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Golden God in the hut above who guards the
secret of the sacred treasure. It is said that some day
this image will speak and tell where the lost altar lies.&#8221;</p>
<p>The whole tribe was in the grip of an awful terror
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
over this disappearance. But the Priest proved master
of the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be found,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In the excitement Sorez found his opportunity to
escape, with the help of the girl, the image still beneath
his coat,&ndash;&ndash;the image fated to light in him the same
fires which drove on Raleigh and Quesada. Before
he reached the home trail he had a chance to see this
strange Priest of whom he had heard so much in connection
with the rumored treasure in the lake. He
came upon him, a tall, sallow-faced man, when within
an hour of safety. Sorez had never before met eyes
such as looked from beneath the skull-like forehead of
this man; they bored, bored like hot iron. The Priest
spoke good English.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave the image,&#8221; he said quietly.</p>
<p>Sorez, his hand upon a thirty-two caliber revolver,
laughed (even as Quesada had laughed) and disappeared
in the dark. The next time he met the Priest
was many months later and many thousand miles from
the Andes.</p>
<p>The girl who, at the command of her father, had
given Sorez the image was made an exile in consequence
of this act by a decree of the priest. But the
thread of love is universal. It is the strain out of
which springs all idealism&ndash;&ndash;even the notion of God&ndash;&ndash;and
as such is bounded by neither time nor place. It
is in the beating hearts of all things human&ndash;&ndash;the definition
perhaps of humanity. Civilization differs from
savagery in many things, but both have in common,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
after all, whatever is eternal; and love is the thing
alone which we know to be eternal. Just human love&ndash;&ndash;love
of man for woman and woman for man.</p>
<p>Flores followed her into the mountains among which
they had both grown. <a name="P291"></a>He built a shelter for her,
bought sheep and toiled for her, and with her, found
the best of all that a larger life brings to many. The
Priest, of course, could have easily annihilated the
two, but he hesitated. There was something in the
hearts of his people with which he dare not tamper.
So the two had been able to live their idyl in peace,
though Flores slept always with one eye open and his
knife near.</p>
<p>It was quite by accident that Sorez and the tired girl
came upon the two at the finish of his second journey
into these mountains. The woman in the hut recognized
him instantly and bade him welcome. The one-room
structure was given up to the women while Flores
built near it a leanto for himself and Sorez. This
simplified things mightily for the exhausted travelers,
and gave them at once the opportunity for much-needed
rest. They slept the major part of two days, but Sorez
again showed his remarkable recuperative powers by
awaking with all his old-time strength of body and
mind. He accepted the challenge of the lake and
mountains with all his former fearlessness. He
thought no more of the danger which lurked near him
than he did of the possible failure of his expedition.
It was this magnificent domination of self, this utter
scorn of circumstance, which made such a situation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
as this in which he now found himself with the girl
possible. No ordinary man would, with so weak a
frame, have dared face such a venture.</p>
<p>To the girl he had been as thoughtful and as kind
as a father. He lavished upon her a care and affection
that seemed to find relief for whatever uneasiness of
conscience he felt. Though Sorez realized that the
Priest must know of his presence here and would spare
no effort to get the image, he felt safe enough in this
hut. With a few simple defenses Flores had made
secret approach to the hut practically impossible. The
cliff walls protected them from the rear, while approach
from the front could be made only by the lake,
save for short distances on either side. Across these
spaces Flores had sprinkled dry twigs and so sensitive
had his hearing become by his constant watchfulness
that he would awake instantly upon the snapping of
one of these. As a further precaution he placed his
sheep at night within this enclosure, knowing that no
one could approach without exciting them to a panic.</p>
<p>Moreover, Sorez suspected that the Priest had kept
secret from the tribe his failure to recover the image
after his long absence in pursuit of it. Not only was
such a loss a reflection on his power, but it challenged
the power of the Golden Man himself. Would the Sun
God allow such a thing? Could the image be gone
with no divine manifestations of its loss? Such questions
were sure to be asked. The Priest had no men
he could trust with a secret so important. He would
work alone. The matter would end with a rifle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
bullet or a stab in the dark&ndash;&ndash;if it ended in favor of
the Priest. With the vanishing of the treasure and
the return of the image&ndash;&ndash;if in favor of Sorez.</p>
<p>During the three days they had spent at the lake
Jo had grown very serious and thoughtful. This
seemed such a fairy world in which they were living
that things took on new values. The two were seated
around the fire with Flores and his wife in the shadows,
when the girl spoke of new fears which had possessed
her lately. Led on as much by what she herself saw
and continued to see in the crystals, by the fascination
she found in venturing into these new and strange
countries, but above all by the domination of this
stronger and older personality, she had until now
followed without much sober thinking. If she hesitated,
if she paused, he had only to tell of some rumor
of a strange seaman in the city of Bogova or repeat
one of the dozen wild tales current of Americans who
had gone into the interior in search of gold and there
been lost for years to turn up later sound and rich.
He had hurried her half asleep from the house at
Bogova and frightened her into silent obedience by
suggesting that Wilson might by force take her back
home when upon the eve of finding her father. She
had looked again into the crystal and as always had
seen him wandering among big hills in a region much
like this. What did it all mean? She did not know,
but now a deeper, more insistent longing was lessening
the hold of the other. Her thoughts in the last
few days had gone back more often than ever they had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
to the younger man who had played, with such vivid,
brilliant strokes, so important a part in her life. She
felt, what was new to her, a growing need of him&ndash;&ndash;a
need based on nothing tangible and yet none the less
eager. She turned to Sorez.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am almost getting discouraged,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;When shall we turn back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Soon. Soon. Have you lost interest in the treasure
altogether?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The treasure never mattered very much to me,
did it? You have done your best to help me find my
father, and for that I am willing to help you with this
other thing. But I am beginning to think that neither
of the quests is real.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added impulsively:</p>
<p>&#8220;Twice I have left the most real thing in my life&ndash;&ndash;once
at home and once in Bogova. I shall not do it
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You refer to Wilson?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Here in the mountains&ndash;&ndash;here with Flores
and his wife, I am beginning to see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What, my girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That things of to-day are better worth than things
of to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorez shifted a bit uneasily. He had come to care
a great deal for the girl&ndash;&ndash;to find her occupying the
place in his heart left empty by the death of the niece
who lived in Boston. He was able less and less to consider
her impersonally even in the furtherance of this
project. He would have given one half the fortune he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
expected, really to be able to help the girl to her father.
He had lied&ndash;&ndash;lied, taking advantage of this passionate
devotion to entice her to the shores of this lake with
her extraordinary gift of crystal-seeing. He was beginning
to wonder if it were worth while. At any rate,
he would be foolish not to reap the reward of his
deceit at this point.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he concluded brusquely, &#8220;we must not get
gloomy on the eve of victory. To-morrow the moon is
full&ndash;&ndash;do you think you will be strong enough to come
with me to-morrow night to the shrine of the Golden
Man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered indifferently.</p>
<p>&#8220;He chose his own and surely he will not desert
the agent of his choosing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered the girl.</p>
<p>Her eyes rested a moment upon the silver lake before
her and then upon the cliffs beyond. She had an odd desire
this evening to get nearer to those walls of granite.
A dozen times she had found her eyes turning to them
and each time she obeyed the impulse it was followed
by a new longing for David. She wished he were
here with her now. She wished he was to be with her
to-morrow night when Sorez took her out upon the lake
with him. She did not mind gazing into the eyes of
the image, of sinking under their spell, but now&ndash;&ndash;this
time&ndash;&ndash;she would feel better if he were near her.
She had a feeling as though he <i>were</i> somewhere near
her&ndash;&ndash;as though he were up there near the cliffs which
she faced.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3><i>What the Stars Saw</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">The</span> moon shone broadly over a pool of purplish
quicksilver. A ragged fringe of trees bordered
it like a wreath. The waters were quiet&ndash;&ndash;very, very
quiet. They scarcely rippled the myriad stars which
glittered back mockingly at those above. The air over
and above it all was the thin air of the skies, not of the
earth. It was as silent here as in the purple about the
planets. Man seemed too coarse for so fine a setting.
Even woman, nearest of all creatures to fairy stuff,
must needs be at her best to make a fitting part of this.</p>
<p>From out of the shadows of this fringe of trees
there stole silently another shadow. This moved
slowly like a funeral barge away from the shore. As
it came full into the radius of that silver light (a light
matching the dead) it seemed more than ever one with
sheeted things, for half prone upon this raft lay a girl
whose cheeks were white against the background of
her black hair and whose eyes saw nothing of the
world about her. She stared more as the dead stare
than the living,&ndash;&ndash;stared into the shining eyes of the
golden image which she held with rigid arms upon
her knees, the image which had entangled so many
lives. Her bosom moved rhythmically, slowly, showing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
that she was not dead. The golden image stared
back at her. Its eyes caught the moonbeams in its
brilliant surfaces, so that it looked more a living thing
than she who held it.</p>
<p>Facing them, standing bolt upright save when he
stooped a trifle to reach forward with his paddle, was
Sorez, who might have passed for Charon. His thin
frame, his hollow cheeks, the intense look of his burning
eyes gave him a ghostly air. The raft moved without
a sound, scarcely rippling the waters before it,
scarcely disturbing in its wake the gaunt shadow cast
by Sorez, which followed them like a pursuing spectre.
He studied keenly the dumb shores which lay in a
broad circumference about them. He could see every
yard of the lake and saw that they themselves were the
only scar upon its mirror surface.</p>
<p>Peak upon peak looked down upon them, and higher,
star upon star. Dead, indifferent things they were,
chance accessories to this drama. They awaited the
touch of sterner forces than those of man for their
changes.</p>
<p>He who drove the raft along breathed as one who is
trying hard to control himself in the face of a great
emotion. His eyes continually shifted from the girl
to the shores, then back again to the girl. In this way
he reached a position near the middle of the lake.
Here he paused.</p>
<p>He seemed to hesitate at the next step as though a
great deal depended upon it. His lips moved, but he
seemed afraid to break the silence. The girl remained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
immovable, still staring into the glittering eyes of the
image. He studied her eagerly as though he would
lead her mind before he spoke, for upon the first reply
to his question depended the success or failure of all
he had dared, of all he had undertaken. As she
answered, either he would be the laughing stock of
the world, or the most famous of modern adventurers;
a comparatively poor man, or the richest in jewels of
all the world. Suddenly he stooped and, bending close
to the ear of the girl, said very distinctly:</p>
<p>&#8220;We are on the lake of Guadiva. It is said that
here below the waters lies the shrine of the Golden
One. You can see below the waters. Is&ndash;&ndash;the shrine&ndash;&ndash;here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her lips moved uncertainly; an indistinct muttering
followed. He held his breath in his excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The shrine&ndash;&ndash;it is&ndash;&ndash;it is below.&#8221;</p>
<p>His color changed from gray to the red of youth;
his eyes brightened, his whole body seemed to grow
young with new strength. He asked the second question
with feverish impatience,</p>
<p>&#8220;From here is it straight ahead, to the left, or the
right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahead and&ndash;&ndash;and I can&#8217;t see, I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look deeper and you can see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To the right,&#8221; she said decisively.</p>
<p>He dipped the paddle deep and put all his strength
into the strokes. For a hundred yards the ripples
broke in front of the clumsy craft. Again he stopped
and asked the direction. Her lips trembled over the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
words, exactly like those of one talking in sleep. It
was always with an effort that she was able sufficiently
to concentrate herself to give voice to what she saw.
This time she bade him continue straight ahead. So
he proceeded for another hundred yards. In this way
he crossed to within an eighth of a mile of the opposite
shore. Here she bade him pause, in answer to his
questioning. He was not an emotional man, but he
had never been under such a tension as during this
man&oelig;uvering or felt such a variety of sensations.</p>
<p>&#8220;To the left,&#8221; she muttered. And then almost
querulously, &#8220;I can&#8217;t find it. It is near here, but I
do not see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She moved him almost in a circle, and still back
and forth, back and forth without seeming able to
locate the spot for which she sought. They were opposite
two high cliffs which revealed a deep fissure
between them. Now and again her head turned upwards
to this spot and her face became troubled&ndash;&ndash;the
brows coming together in a puzzled scowl, which sometimes
faded away into a look of fear. Once, with a
startled cry, she put her hands up over her eyes and
swayed back and forth with low moaning. He roused
her from this by a sharp command, and she turned
again to the lake with no trace of this disturbance.
He began to get worried as she reached no definite
spot. It was possible that she could not bring him to
any smaller radius than this circle. This would leave
a doubt so serious as after all to bring things to nothing.
He stooped again.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The altar&ndash;&ndash;it is near here? We must find it&ndash;&ndash;find
it. Look deep&ndash;&ndash;look in all directions&ndash;&ndash;look
without fear. You must find it&ndash;&ndash;the altar of the
Golden One with its treasure. You must find it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she only raised her head and fixed her staring
eyes upon the dark cliffs. She looked as though she
were listening very intently,&ndash;&ndash;as to a cry from a distance
of which she was not sure.</p>
<p>Her lips formed the word &#8220;David.&#8221; He caught it
and it startled him so that for a moment he followed
her eyes, listening too. But beyond there was nothing
but the sober height of barren rock standing stark
against the sky. There was no movement below on
the shore; there was no shadow upon the lake. Yet
with eyes fixed upon this scene she still called the
name, &#8220;David, David.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorez placed his hand upon her forehead. He concentrated
the full power of his mind upon the quest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Below&ndash;&ndash;below&ndash;&ndash;you must look below, not above.
You must see nothing but the altar of the Golden One.
Below, deep, deep&ndash;&ndash;look, search until you find it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her features became smooth once more and she
obeyed the command. She said very distinctly this
time.</p>
<p>&#8220;The altar is here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Below us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He doubted&ndash;&ndash;doubted even as the blood rushed
through his veins with the gladness of her words. He
doubted as one will to prolong the joy of the truth. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
there still remained much else to be learned. It was
possible that the treasure was not so great as had been
reported. If only she could see it lying there; if only
she could tell him of the bars of yellow gold, of the
glittering heaps of precious stones, of the jumbled
pile of golden plate which had lain there for so
long! The thought of it was enough to start the
fever of desire. He wished even that he could force
her to go down there and bring up to him a bit that
he himself could touch and see and weigh. As he
stood beside her with the lust of this thing in his
eyes, a shadow detached itself from the shore. It
may have been only the reflection of a tiny cloud.
But there were no clouds. It may have been just a
bit of driftwood. But it moved slowly and steadily
towards the raft.</p>
<p>Sorez bent above the girl again.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Golden Man will tell you. Look into his eyes
very hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl grasped the image more tightly and obeyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now go below, deep&ndash;&ndash;deep.&#8221;</p>
<p>For some reason, even as she had done in the room
when first she had held this thing, she drew back in
fear at this.</p>
<p>&#8220;No! No!&#8221; she pleaded.</p>
<p>But Sorez had lost sight of her as a personality now;
she was nothing but a means to this one end; nothing
but an adjunct to this heathen idol. He repeated his
command more decisively&ndash;&ndash;more sternly. His words
were sharp&ndash;&ndash;cold.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></div>
<p>The shadow which had left the shore still came
nearer&ndash;&ndash;silently, swiftly.</p>
<p>The girl rested her frightened eyes upon the brilliant
jewels set below the ugly, squat brow. They glowed
in answer. They sparkled like tiny fires. Her face
grew strained&ndash;&ndash;her breathing became more rapid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deeper&ndash;&ndash;deeper!&#8221;</p>
<p>The shadow had come very near. Had the girl
not been looking so intently into the crystal eyes,
she could have seen&ndash;&ndash;could have warned. The moon
now showed it to be a canoe and in the canoe a man.
The man was very lean and his uncovered head was
close shaven. His eyes were very like those in the
image.</p>
<p>The girl shuddered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deeper&ndash;&ndash;deeper!&#8221; came the relentless command.</p>
<p>Her voice came back muffled&ndash;&ndash;as though from a
distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is dark&ndash;&ndash;dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>She began to gasp. Then suddenly she placed her
hand to her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see no gold&ndash;&ndash;I see no gold!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorez sank to his knees before the girl. His face
was chalk white.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone? Is it gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>The shadow was now beside the raft. The shadow
was now behind Sorez. The shadow placed one foot
upon the raft, but it paused there a moment at the
cry which brought Sorez also to attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father!&#8221; screamed the girl. &#8220;Father!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></div>
<p>Sorez stared straight ahead of him in a frenzy.
Then the shadow sprang, throwing his arms about the
tall figure. Without a cry Sorez sank under him. He
made a brief struggle but he was too weak to overcome
the demon strength of the man who bore him down.
With remarkable dexterity, the Priest bound him hand
and foot before he had recovered fully from the shock of
the fall.</p>
<p>The girl was now murmuring to herself, murmuring
the one word &#8220;Father.&#8221; It was an appealing, frightened
cry, full of doubt, uncertainty, and yet of hungry
love. For a second it held the attention of both men,
the Priest taking a step nearer the girl and looking at
her almost curiously.</p>
<p>Sorez knew this was the end. But he was a good
gambler; having lost all, he accepted his fate with
stoicism. He kept his head clear&ndash;&ndash;clear enough to
do the thing which marked him a man. He squirmed
about until he faced the girl. With every ounce of
strength in him, he shouted his final command to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Awake! Awake!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl stirred uneasily. The Priest reached for
his knife, not understanding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Awake!&#8221; repeated Sorez, and his voice quivered
with the intensity of his earnestness. &#8220;Awake!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl trembled and seemed to fight her way to
consciousness as one after a deep dive struggles to the
top. She gasped for breath. Her eyes fluttered open,
closed, fluttered open again. She roused herself to a
sitting posture and the image dropped from her lap.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
The Priest snatched it up as the girl shrank back from
him. For a moment the two stared at each other.
The Priest was held motionless. Then as Sorez hitched
a bit to one side, he turned to his work.</p>
<p>Sorez hoped for nothing but a swift end. The cruel
face of the other left nothing to question, nothing else
to hope. But now that the girl had shaken off the influence
of the image he was easier. There was but
one thing left to try, even though the eyes looking
down into his hinted at nothing of mercy; he must
save the girl if possible.</p>
<p>As the Priest bent over him, he found his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to me a moment. I have nothing to ask
for myself, I took my chances and I lost. But the
girl here&ndash;&ndash;she is innocent of even wishing for your
treasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why then is she here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I brought her here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could not&ndash;&ndash;against her will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorez moistened his lips and explained: &#8220;She came
on another mission. She came in search of a father
who has been long missing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To this lake&ndash;&ndash;to this spot&ndash;&ndash;with the image in
her lap?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;this part of it is at my prompting. She
but obeyed me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Priest turned away impatiently. He saw the
girl crouching in terror of him. He moved nearer.
He saw her black eyes. They remained on his strangely
immovable. He felt something of a tremor. Things
about him became blurred for a moment. He shook
himself free.</p>

</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I have heard too many stories,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, good God! you believe this,&#8221; burst out Sorez.
&#8220;You haven&#8217;t the heart to revenge yourself upon her?
You&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He checked himself. He knew the man would do
as he most feared. This, then, was to be his punishment&ndash;&ndash;to
know that he had brought the girl to such
an end as this&ndash;&ndash;that he had won her trust and confidence
and rewarded it with such torture as this demon
might mete out to her. The Priest might even slay
her before his eyes. He strained at the rope which
bound him until it tore into his flesh. The waters
played about the raft. The stars danced in the ripples.</p>
<p>Sorez brought himself to try once more.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have a spark of pity in your heart, you will
do her no harm. Listen! I lied to the girl. I brought
her here on the hope that she might find this father
who has been a long time gone from home. He was a
sea captain and I told her that many captains had been
lost here in the mountains and been found again. I
told her that I had seen her father in Bogova. That
is why she came.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To the lake?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorez had but a second in which to decide. If he
told the Priest of the girl&#8217;s power, the latter might
slay her to bury the secret, or torture her to betray it
to him. No, it would be safer to leave the Priest
merely suspicious.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></div>
<p>&#8220;As I am about to die,&#8221; affirmed Sorez, solemnly,
&#8220;that is God&#8217;s truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Priest placed the little golden idol out of danger.
Then he stooped and bound the ropes more tightly
about the ankles of the prostrate man. Sorez watched
him with new interest&ndash;&ndash;almost with a new hope. He
glanced at the girl and saw her kneeling upon the raft,
her white face to the moon.</p>
<p>The Priest bent to fasten the rope which already bit
into the flesh above the arms. It was for this Sorez had
prayed. As the Priest stooped, his long coat swayed
within reach of the long-waiting fingers. Sorez gripped
both laps and that grip was the grip of death.</p>
<p>Before the Priest understood the situation, Sorez
had bent his bound legs double beneath him and, gripping
the tightly bound straw with his heels, shoved
with all his strength towards the edge of the raft. The
Priest fell atop of him, but instantly tore himself back.
The fingers held. Once again Sorez hitched forward
and once again the Priest came with him. In a panic
the crazed Priest bore his knees down upon the prostrate
man and then swung off to one side. But the fingers
held. Sorez was now lying with his head half over
the edge. The silver waters lipped his gray hair. He
raised his legs once more&ndash;&ndash;just once more, and shoved.</p>
<p>He gained an inch. Then in a flash the Priest
managed to stand up with Sorez still clinging. But
only for a moment, when he fell backwards, striking
the back of his head sharply upon the logs. The girl
screamed in fright. The Priest saw the world swim
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
before his eyes, and the next second looked up to find
a woman&ndash;&ndash;his own daughter&ndash;&ndash;his Jo&ndash;&ndash;looking
back at him! But Sorez still clung and still shoved
with his legs towards the edge of the boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake&ndash;&ndash;what are you about?&#8221; gasped
he who a moment gone had been the Priest.</p>
<p>Sorez saw nothing of the change. He was busy
bending up his legs, digging in his heels, and shoving.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father! Father!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorez had heard the cry before. He felt the girl
beating at him with her white hands. The raft was
beginning to settle. In the heavy fall of the two men
a section had been loosened so that now it might possibly
hold two of them&ndash;&ndash;no more. The girl realized
this; the man realized this. Sorez knew nothing save
his determination to drag the Priest to the bottom with
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him go!&#8221; shouted the girl. &#8220;Let him go!
He is my father! Can&#8217;t you hear?&#8221;</p>
<p>The words penetrated just as he was about to shove
once more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick! We are sinking!&#8221;</p>
<p>He let go. The Priest sprang to his feet. The canoe
had gone and the loosely constructed raft was settling
as timber after timber freed itself. Sorez, himself
again, saw this. Without a word he shoved once more,&ndash;&ndash;this
time himself alone. He went down and the
raft floated. He had kept his word after all; he had
given the girl her father.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3><i>A Lucky Bad Shot</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">As</span> soon as they recovered sufficient strength to
desire anything more of life than rest for their
bruised and weary bodies, Wilson assumed command
of the situation. He saw nothing but a straight path
to the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must get down to the lake,&#8221; he said firmly.
&#8220;Get down there and find Sorez. If the natives are
up in arms, I want to be near the girl. I&#8217;m going to
take her out of here. If the others refuse to join us,
we&#8217;ll take her alone and make a dash for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We oughter get our provisions first,&#8221; suggested
Stubbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;what strength we have left is for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have twice as much with grub.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ll have less time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson&#8217;s jaw was set. To go down the mountain and
back would take at least four hours and leave them
even nearer dead than they were at present. Aside
from that, the desire to see the girl had become an
obsession. He was no longer amenable to reason.
He felt the power to dominate. In the last two days
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
he had learned that there are at least two essential
things in life&ndash;&ndash;two things a man has a right to take
where he finds them&ndash;&ndash;love and water. The two lay
at his feet now and he would wait no longer. His
heart burned with as hot a thirst as his throat. Neither
Sorez nor gold nor all the brown men in the universe
should balk him of them longer.</p>
<p>Leaning forward he gripped the arm of his comrade
with a strength the latter had not thought within him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Old man,&#8221; he said with a new ring in his voice,
&#8220;you must follow me the rest of this journey. I&#8217;ve
got down to one thing now&ndash;&ndash;just one thing. I&#8217;m
going to find this girl&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m going to take her into
these two arms&ndash;&ndash;and I&#8217;m going to carry her out
of here and never let her go. Do you understand?
And there isn&#8217;t gold enough, nor men enough, nor
heathen images enough in the world to stop me
now. We&#8217;re going back, Stubbs&ndash;&ndash;the girl and I&ndash;&ndash;we&#8217;re
going back, and God help those who get in our
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>At first Stubbs thought this was the fever, but as
he looked at the tense face, the locked jaw, the burning
eyes, he saw it was only a man in earnest. Some spark
within his own breast warmed to life before this passion.
He put out his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I signs with you right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve turned aside for things all I&#8217;m going to,&#8221;
ran on Wilson, excitedly. &#8220;Now I&#8217;m going over
them. I&#8217;m going straight&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m going hard&ndash;&ndash;and
I&#8217;m not going to turn my back on her again for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
second. Do you understand, Stubbs? She&#8217;s mine
and I&#8217;m going to take her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t have to take her, if you feel that way,&#8221;
answered Stubbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;What d&#8217; you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll go, boy&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;ll go through Hell with you
with thet look in your eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then come on,&#8221; shouted Wilson, with quite unnecessary
fierceness. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to pull out of this
heathen web.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men rose to their tired feet, every muscle
protesting, and before dark Stubbs learned how little
the body counts, how little anything counts, before the
will of a man who has focused the might of his soul
upon a single thing. They moved down ever towards
the blue lake which blinked back at the sun like a blue-eyed
babe. Their rifles pressed upon their shoulders
like bars of lead; their heavy feet were numb; their
eyes bulged from their heads with the strain of keeping
them open. Of the long, bitter struggle, it is enough
to say that it was a sheer victory over the impossible.
Each mile was a blank, yet they pressed forward,
Wilson ever in the lead, Stubbs ever plodding behind.
It was almost as though they were automatons galvanized
by some higher intelligence, for their own had
become numbed save to the necessity of still dragging
their feet ahead. In this way they reached the shores
of the lake; in this way they circled it; in this way
they neared the hut of Flores. Stumbling along the
trail, guided by some instinct, Wilson raised his head
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
at the sight of two figures sitting in the sun by the
door of the hut; one was the girl, he saw that clearly
enough, for to his own vision it was as the sun breaking
through low-hanging clouds; but the other&ndash;&ndash;he
motioned Stubbs to halt. The two had made no noise,
coming up through the undergrowth from the lake,
and were now able to conceal themselves partly behind
a sort of high bush. Had those in the hut been alert,
the two could not have escaped detection, but so intent
they seemed upon their conversation that a dozen
men might have approached. Wilson tried to control
himself; he wished to make sure. Steadying
himself by a grip upon the shoulder of Stubbs, he
looked again. Then bending close to his comrade&#8217;s
ear, he asked him&ndash;&ndash;waiting without drawing breath
for reply,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer came charged with bitterness,</p>
<p>&#8220;The Priest!&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson lowered his rifle. The Priest was sitting
some two feet from the girl, against the hut, his head
thrown back as though he were trying hard to think.
Wilson was a good shot; he had as a boy amused himself
by the hour with his small, twenty-two caliber rifle.
At this moment, however, his sight was none of the
best and his hand anything but steady. Stubbs signaled
him to let him try the shot, but Wilson would
not trust him. He had no doubt but that the Priest
had killed Sorez and was now holding the girl a
prisoner, perhaps even anticipating her death. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
his duty, his privilege, to set her free. He fitted the
stock of the weapon into his armpit, and raised the
barrel. His hand was weak; the gun trembled so that
he dared not shoot. Stubbs saw this and, stepping in
front of him, motioned him to rest the barrel on his
shoulder. With this support he found his aim steadier.
He purposely gave a bit of a margin to the right, so
that in case of any deflection the error would be away
from the girl. He pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>When the wisp of smoke cleared away, Wilson saw
that both figures were upon their feet&ndash;&ndash;the girl in
the arms of the priest who held her close to him as
though to protect her. Their eyes were upon him. The
girl stared in terror, then in surprise, and now, struggling
free, stood as though looking at an apparition.</p>
<p>Wilson understood nothing of this. His brain was
now too slow working to master fresh details. He
still grasped nothing but the fact that the girl was
there and by her side the man who had proved himself
a mortal enemy. He raised his weapon once
more.</p>
<p>With a scream the girl ran straight ahead towards
him, in line with the astonished man by the hut. As
she ran she called,</p>
<p>&#8220;David! David! David!&#8221;</p>
<p>He heard the call and, dropping the rifle, staggered
towards her. He held out his arms to her and she
checked her steps, studying his eyes as though to make
sure he was sane. He stood motionless but there was
a prayer in his silent lips, in his eyes, in his outstretched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
arms. She took another little step towards
him, then, without further hesitation, came to his side
and placed her head upon his shoulder. He folded his
arms over her heaving shoulders&ndash;&ndash;he rested his cheek
upon her black hair&ndash;&ndash;he whispered her name again
and again.</p>
<p>So they stood, Stubbs and the Priest both staring at
them as at the central figures upon the stage, until
she raised her head to look once more into his eyes.
He saw her lips within a few inches of his own, but
he dared not kiss them yet. It was odd&ndash;&ndash;he had never
in his life spoken an audible word of love to her&ndash;&ndash;had
never written of love to her&ndash;&ndash;and yet he knew
that she knew all that had been unsaid, even as he did.
There had never been need of words with them. Love
had been developed in the consciousness of each in
silence and in loneliness, but had moved to this climax
as surely and as inevitably as though foreordained.
He had but to look down into her eyes now and all
was said; she had but to look into his, even deadened
as they were by fatigue, to read all her heart craved.
Her breath came in little gasps.</p>
<p>&#8220;David&ndash;&ndash;David, you have come for me again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the last time,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are never going to let me go again, are you,
David?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; he answered fiercely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! hold me tight, David.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew her more firmly to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tighter! Tighter!&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span></div>
<p>He crushed her against his pounding heart. He
ached with the joy of it. But with the relief from the
heavy burden of fear which had for so long weighed
him down, nature asserted herself and forced down
his leaden eyelids. She felt him sinking in her arms
and freed herself. With her hands upon his shoulders
she drew back and looked hungrily at him. His sandy
hair was tangled and frowsy, his eyes shot with tiny
threads of red, his cheeks bronzed and covered with a
shaggy light beard. His clothes were tattered, and
about his waist there dangled a circle of leather bags.
He was an odd enough looking figure. By some strange
chance she had never seen him in other than some
uncouth garb; drenched with rain, draped in an
Oriental lounging robe, with a cartridge belt about
his waist, and covered with sweat and powder grime,
and now in this.</p>
<p>Both were brought back to the world about them
by a shot from Stubbs. He had fired at the Priest
and missed. It was as though the man led a charmed
life. The girl raised her hand as Stubbs was about
to fire again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t! Don&#8217;t! You are making a terrible mistake.
This isn&#8217;t the Priest&ndash;&ndash;he is my father.&#8221;</p>
<p>The phrase awoke even the sleeping sense of these
men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father!&#8221; exclaimed Wilson.</p>
<p>But the man was coming towards them&ndash;&ndash;steadily,
and yet as if in a sort of daze.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the meaning of this?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span></div>
<p>The eyes, the high cheek-bones, the thin lips, were
those of the Priest, but the voice was different. It
had lost something of its harshness&ndash;&ndash;something, too,
of its decisiveness. The girl interrupted,</p>
<p>&#8220;This is no time for explanations. Come into the
hut. We must rest first.&#8221;</p>
<p>She led the way, keeping a tight grip upon Wilson&#8217;s
arm, steadying him. Stubbs and he whom they had
known as the Priest followed.</p>
<p>Within the hut Flores and his wife, still bewildered
by the sudden conversion of the Priest from an enemy
to a friend (understanding nothing of what had
happened), crouched far into the rear overcome with
genuine awe and reverence for the guardian of their
god in his new character. Threats had driven them
to rebellion while kindliness now made of them abject
slaves. They stood ready to obey his slightest wish&ndash;&ndash;not
with cravenness, but with quick reversion to the
faith of their ancestors. But he acted as though he
did not see them&ndash;&ndash;as though, in fact, he saw nothing
of anything about him save the girl. He followed her
with his eyes with almost childlike eagerness and
greeted a glance from her with almost pathetic joy.
He spoke little, apparently finding difficulty in expressing
himself&ndash;&ndash;in forming his scattered thoughts
into correct sentences. His whole appearance was that
of a man freed after a long imprisonment. The only
thing of his present surroundings which he now grasped
perfectly was his relationship with the girl. He was
reviving old-time joys in his daughter.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span></div>
<p>But Jo herself, even in the freshness of her happiness
over the unexpected success of her long journey,
had found an even greater interest in this
newer passion. She spread a blanket for Wilson in a
corner of the hut and forced him to lie down here
and give himself up to sleep. Stubbs sank to the
ground in the sun where he stood outside and fell into
a stupor.</p>
<p>Hour after hour the girl sat at Wilson&#8217;s side as
though guarding his rest, and in this gentle task she
found a new conception of happiness. Near her, during
the long vigil, sat her father, while in and out,
softly as two shadows, moved Flores and his wife.</p>
<p>Wilson awoke long before Stubbs and insisted upon
getting up. There were many things to be learned
and many things to be done. He realized that they
were still in the heart of a hostile country and that
if they were to get out safely, time could not be wasted
in sleep. What part this man whom he still thought
of as the Priest would play, he had no idea.</p>
<p>The girl told him as much of the odd story as she
had gathered, beginning with her own arrival in the hut.
Manning&#8217;s memory dated from the blow on the raft.
Back of this he skipped an interval of fifteen years.
Even there his memory was cloudy. He recalled
vaguely having joined an expedition which had for
its object prospecting in these mountains, but who the
others of the party were he did not know. He remembered
hazily the trip over the mountains and a
battle with a party of natives. He was injured and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
after this was sick a long while. As far as he was
concerned he had been unconscious ever since that time.
Of his recovery, of the strange sequence of events
which caused him to take up a life among the Chibcas,
who elevated him finally into the position of high
priest, of the fanatical devotion to his trust which had
driven him across the continent and then across an
ocean to recover the image, he recalled nothing. He
did not know of the existence of an idol or of any
superstition in connection with it.</p>
<p>Wilson, listening, marveled, but he quickly associated
this with similar cases of dual identity brought
about by brain trouble following an accident to the
skull. The psychology of the case, however, did not
at present so much interest him as the possible consequences
to them all which might follow this d&eacute;nouement.
It instantly occurred to him that it was doubtful
if Manning in his present condition was anything but
an added menace to the party. A half hour&#8217;s questioning
convinced Wilson that it was literally true that
the last fifteen years were a blank to the man and that
his mental condition at present was scarcely superior
to that of a child. Consequently, in the event of an
attack by the aroused natives either Manning would
be thought to have been captured by the party, which
would bring down swift vengeance, or he would be
thought to have deserted them, which was equally sure
to bring about the annihilation of them all. The only
thing to do seemed to be to keep the man out of sight
as much as possible on the journey and in the event of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
trouble to hide him altogether. It seemed to him
wisest not to allow them to rest even that night but to
push on. Flores, eager to do anything for the Priest,
agreed to guide them. He aroused Stubbs, and after
a good meal the party started and without incident
made eight miles before they stopped.</p>
<p>They found a good camping place&ndash;&ndash;a sort of crude
cave near a brook and just off the trail. They built
a fire and cooked a portion of the leg of mutton which
Flores had brought for them before returning. So
far they had not caught a glimpse of a native. This
fact and the excitement of actually being upon the
home path banished them completely from their minds.
But that night both men agreed that each had better
take his turn at watching.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take the first watch,&#8221; insisted Wilson to
Stubbs. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t trust you to wake me up.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a good-natured grin Stubbs submitted and
threw his tired body on the turf, making a pillow of
the bags of jewels. He slept as heartily as though
snug in the bunk of a safe ship. But both the girl
and her father refused to take Wilson&#8217;s advice and
do likewise. Both insisted upon sharing his watch with
him. The father sat on the other side of his daughter
staring, as though still wondering, into the shadows of
the silent wood kingdom about him. He spoke but
little and seemed to be still trying to clear his thoughts.</p>
<p>At their backs rose the towering summits which still
stood between them and the ocean; above those the
stars which from the first had seemed to watch their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
lives; before them the heavy, silent shadows which
bade them be ever alert.</p>
<p>Wilson sat upright with his rifle over his knees.
The girl nestled against his shoulder. All was well
with the world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3><i>Dangerous Shadows</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">In</span> the narration of what had befallen her while
in the care of Sorez, Wilson came to have a new
conception of the man. With the exception of the
fact that Sorez had considered his own interest alone
in bringing the girl down here, and that he had lured
her on by what he knew to be a deliberate lie, Sorez
had been as kind and as thoughtful of her as her own
father could have been. After their imprisonment in
Bogova and while in hiding from Wilson he had supplied
the girl with the best of nurses and physicians.
Furthermore, in order to make what recompense he
could to her in case of an accident to him or in the
event of the failure of their mission, he had, before
leaving Bogova, made his will, bequeathing to her every
cent of his real and personal property. The chief item
of this was the house in Boston which he had purchased
as a home for himself and niece, a few months before
the latter&#8217;s death. In addition to this he had in the
end made the supreme sacrifice&ndash;&ndash;he had given his
life.</p>
<p>Sitting there in the starlight she told Wilson these
things, with a sob in her voice.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And so he kept his word after all&ndash;&ndash;didn&#8217;t he?
He brought me to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The older man by her side looked up at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;My daughter,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;My daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>She placed her arm over his shoulder scarcely able
to believe the good fortune which had at once placed
her here between her father and her lover.</p>
<p>&#8220;The golden idol did some good after all,&#8221; she
whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idol?&#8221; asked her father. &#8220;What idol?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You remember nothing of an image?&#8221; broke in
Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;An image? An idol? I have seen them. I have
seen them, but&ndash;&ndash;but I can&#8217;t remember where.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spoke with a sort of childlike, apologetic whine.
Wilson hesitated a moment. He had brought the idol
with him after finding it in the hut where Manning
had carried it from the raft&ndash;&ndash;apparently unconsciously&ndash;&ndash;and
had taken it, fearing to leave it with
Flores. He had intended to throw it away in the
mountains in some inaccessible place where it could
never again curse human lives. This image ought to
be final proof as to whether or not Manning could
recall anything of his life as a priest of the Sun God
or not. If the sight of this failed to arouse his dead
memory, then nothing ever could. Of all the things in
this life among these mountains no one thing had ever
figured so prominently or so vitally in his life as this.
About this had centered all his fanatical worship&ndash;&ndash;all
his power.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span></div>
<p>As Wilson rose to get the image from where he had
hidden it near Stubbs, the girl seized his arm and,
bending far forward, gasped:</p>
<p>&#8220;The shadow&ndash;&ndash;did you see it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson turned with his weapon cocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>But underneath the trees where she had thought she
saw a movement all was quiet again&ndash;&ndash;all was silent.
With a laugh at her fears, Wilson secured the image
and brought it back. He thrust it towards Manning.
It was clearly visible in the moonlight. The girl
shrank a little away from it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; she shuddered. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like to look at
it to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the dull silver light it appeared heavier and more
somber than in the firelight. It still sat cross-legged
with the same cynical smile about its cruel mouth, the
same bestial expression about the brow, the same low-burning
fires in the spider-like eyes. As Wilson and
her father bent over it she turned away her head.
Once again she seized Wilson&#8217;s arm and bade him
look beyond the thicket in front of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw something move. I am sure of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a bit nervous, I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; he said tenderly.
&#8220;If only you would lie down for the rest of
the night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, David. I am sure this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a shadow. There is a light breeze.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t see anything but&ndash;&ndash;it didn&#8217;t <i>feel</i> like
a shadow, David.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You felt it? Has the image&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he asked a bit
anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;oh, I can&#8217;t make you understand, but
I&#8217;m sure something moved in the bushes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay close to me then,&#8221; he laughed quietly.</p>
<p>He turned back to Manning who was turning the
image over and over in his hands with indifferent
interest. To him it was nothing more than a curio&ndash;&ndash;a
metal doll. But when he caught the glint of a
moonbeam on the jeweled eyes, he bent over it with
keener concern. He raised it in his hands and stared
steadily back into the cold eyes. This stare soon became
fixed and Manning began to grow slightly rigid.
Wilson snatched the object from his hands. For a
moment the man remained immovable; then he rubbed
his hand over his brow, muttering incoherently to himself.
This nervous symptom disappeared and Manning
apparently instantly forgot the idol again. He called
for his daughter. She came closer to his side and he
rested his head against her shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear father,&#8221; she murmured affectionately.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I can&#8217;t think,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try, Daddy. Wait until we get out of here
and you are all well again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could reach my ship,&#8221; he muttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;What ship, Daddy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, my own&ndash;&ndash;the &#8216;Jo Manning.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>That took her back to the time she was a very little
girl. She remembered now that he had named the
ship after her,&ndash;&ndash;the last ship which he had sailed out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
of Newburyport. Poor old daddy! What a different
man he was this moment from him who had held her
in his arms and kissed her with tears rolling down
his bronzed cheeks. It wrenched her heart to watch
him sitting there so listlessly&ndash;&ndash;so weakly&ndash;&ndash;so little
himself. The fear was growing in her heart that he
never would be the same again. Almost&ndash;&ndash;almost it
was better to remember him as he was then than to
know him as he sat there now. Had it not been for
the comfort, for the joy of another order, for the safety
she felt in this younger man by her side, her heart
would have broken at the sight. If only she could have
found him during those few days he was in Boston&ndash;&ndash;when
the crystals had first shown him to her&ndash;&ndash;when
he must have passed within a few feet of her, it
might not then have been so difficult to rouse him.
But at that time he would not have known his own.</p>
<p>A bedlam of raucous, clamorous shrieks settling into
a crude sort of war cry brought all four of them to
their feet. Wilson thrust the girl back of him towards
the cave-like formation behind them. This effectually
protected them in the rear and partly from
two sides. Stubbs swept the bags of jewels into his
arms and carried them to one corner of this natural
excavation. Then he took his position by the side
of Wilson and Manning, who was unarmed. The
three waited the approach of the unseen demons.
Not a light, not the glint of a weapon could be seen.
But before their eyes, in and out among the trees
making up the dense growth, shadows flitted back and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
forth in a sort of ghost dance. In addition to the
hoarse shouting, the air was rent from time to time
by the sound of a blast as from a large horn.</p>
<p>The effect of this upon Manning, who had been
thrust behind them by Wilson, was peculiar. At each
blast he threw back his head and sniffed at the air
as a war horse does at sound of the bugle. His eyes
brightened, his lean frame quivered with emotion, his
hands closed into tight knots. The girl, observing
this, crept closer to him in alarm. She seized his arm
and called to him, but he made no response.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father! Father!&#8221; she shouted above the din.</p>
<p>He started forward a pace, but she drew him back.
Seeing her he came to himself again for a moment.
She scarcely knew him; the old look of intensity
which strained almost every feature out of the normal
had transformed him. He stood now as it were
between two personalities. He partially realized this,
for he stepped forward behind Wilson and shouted:</p>
<p>&#8220;They come! They come! I&ndash;&ndash;I think I can stop
them&ndash;&ndash;for a little. If&ndash;&ndash;if I do, don&#8217;t delay&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t
wait for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson thought he rambled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you hear? Quick&ndash;&ndash;tell me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; shouted Wilson.</p>
<p>The din seemed to be approaching in an ever-narrowing
circle. It came from all sides&ndash;&ndash;a noise so
deafening, so full of unusual sounds that it was in
itself terrifying. Again came the blast, followed by
another and another. Manning caught sight of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
image upon the ground. It acted like magic. He
snatched it up. But the girl, regardless of danger,
ran to his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; she cried in a panic. &#8220;What is the matter,
father?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked down at her with eyes which scarcely
reflected any recognition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go, father. Don&#8217;t you know me? Don&#8217;t
you know your daughter? See, I am Jo&ndash;&ndash;Jo! Do
you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>Even in the midst of this other danger&ndash;&ndash;the noise
and imminent peril, the two men heard and turned
away their heads at the sight with throats straining
with emotion. Manning looked back with hardly a
gleam of his true self showing in his eyes. And yet
there was something left which made him pause&ndash;&ndash;which
in one flash brought him back for a second.
He stooped and kissed her. Then he raised himself
and facing the two men pointed towards the woods
behind them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go,&#8221; he commanded.</p>
<p>Another blast and he clutched the idol to his breast.
He raised his eyes to the East and the three stood
dumbfounded&ndash;&ndash;from his throat there issued a cry so
wild, so weird, that it checked their breathing. Instantly
following there was silence from the shadows.
One, two, three, four seconds passed&ndash;&ndash;still that silence
which was nerve-racking in its intensity. Then a cry
rang out from among the trees so piercing that the girl
put her arm up over her eyes as though to ward off a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
blow. A hundred forms appeared from the trees.
Stubbs and Wilson raised their rifles. But with a
sweeping motion back with his hand, the Priest bade
the two men pause. He disappeared into the shadows
where he was greeted with a sort of p&aelig;an of joy. Then
silence. Then a few sharp-spoken words. Then silence
again.</p>
<p>Wilson, scarcely believing this was not some evil
dream, gripped Stubbs&#8217; arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get out. This&ndash;&ndash;this
is hell.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took the half-swooning girl in his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get a grip on yourself, Jo&ndash;&ndash;just for a little.
We must go&ndash;&ndash;at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Daddy&ndash;&ndash;Daddy&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson closed his eyes as though to shut out the
sight he had last seen when looking into the face of
that man.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is better&ndash;&ndash;as it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stubbs, still with a care for the jewels, helped
Wilson on with his belt and fastened his own into
place. He had had a good rest and felt comparatively
fresh, but the others tottered as they walked.</p>
<p>Into the dark among the trees they went, following
the faint trail which led towards the big mountains
which were still a barrier,&ndash;&ndash;on&ndash;&ndash;on&ndash;&ndash;on until the
girl dropped in her tracks from exhaustion and Wilson
beside her.</p>
<p>For six hours Stubbs maintained a grim watch over
the two, his rifle across his knees, hoping against hope
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
for one bit of good luck more&ndash;&ndash;that if so be there was
another attack, he might have at least one fair shot
at the Priest. Whether the man was the girl&#8217;s father
or not (and he privately doubted the story) he felt
that this was the only thing which would ever take
from his mouth the taste of rope.</p>
<p>But he was disappointed. The morning broke fair
and peaceful with, so far as they could see, the birds
and squirrels the only occupants of this forest besides
themselves. In fact, the next three days save for the
strain of being constantly alert were a sort of idyl for
Wilson and Jo. They had little difficulty in shooting
sufficient food for their needs, and water was plentiful.
The trail led through a fair land gay, at this time of
year, with many flowers.</p>
<p>The girl, to be sure, sobbed at first a good deal
in the dark but the two men knew nothing of this.
Soon, after the first acute pain of the personal loss,
she was able to reason a little with herself. It seemed
to her then, remembering how much a child he was
when with her and how strong and powerful he looked
as he stepped into the woods, that perhaps, after all,
he would be happier with his many children than with
her. Then always there was the opportunity of coming
back to him,&ndash;&ndash;coming under better auspices and with
better opportunities for really bringing him to his own.
It was this last thought that finally brought her real
consolation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; she said to Wilson, hesitating a trifle
in fear that he might not approve of the suggestion,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
&#8220;perhaps some day we can come back here to him,
David.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had thought of it, dear. He saved our lives;
if he had remained, not one of us would have got out
of here. That in itself is enough to make us everlastingly
beholden to him. But&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he paused, &#8220;I think,
dear heart, that it is kinder to let him remain even
among heathen people a strong man with power, than
to bring him back, a child, to die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He chose for himself, David.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&ndash;&ndash;and was able to realize and be glad that he
had been given another chance to do for his daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl thought a moment. Then her face
brightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&ndash;&ndash;that alone makes the trip worth while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&ndash;&ndash;and this,&#8221; he answered, drawing her to
his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;and in a way he gave me
you&ndash;&ndash;he gave me you.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3><i>A Dash for Port</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">The</span> Queen of Carlina, after a restless night, rose
one fair morning early in October and dressed
herself long before the appearance of her maids. There
had been much to disturb her sleep, rumor upon rumor
and arrest after arrest during the last few days, and
last night a long conference with her advisers. Before
she retired she had turned wearily to Otaballo, who
remained a few minutes after the others departed.</p>
<p>&#8220;My General,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;m tired of it all. Let
them do as they will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so long as there is a loyal man to carry a gun,&#8221;
he answered stubbornly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are old, General; it is time you had peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am as young as my queen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is very old to-night,&#8221; she answered, with a
weary smile. &#8220;I fear I am not a real queen,&ndash;&ndash;just
a woman. And women grow old quickly&ndash;&ndash;without
love.&#8221;</p>
<p>The General bit his moustache. He had long seen
that it was more this than the plotting of the Revolutionists
which was undermining his power. He did
not know how to answer.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You have the love of your people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not even that. The sentiment of love for their
queen is dead. That is the root of the whole matter.
There is but one thing, then, for me to do: to retire
gracefully&ndash;&ndash;to anticipate their wishes&ndash;&ndash;to listen to
their cry and declare a republic. Then you and I will
go back to the cottage together and drink our tea in
peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are wrong. That is not the wish of the
people; it is the wish only of a few hundred blackguards
led on by those devils brought here from over
the sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean Dick&#8217;s men?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The devil&#8217;s men. If you give me authority, I&#8217;ll
have every mother&#8217;s son of them shot before morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not even to please my bloodthirsty general. They
have played us false but&ndash;&ndash;still they are countrymen
of his.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You insult him. They belong to no country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; she asked thoughtfully, &#8220;why should I
expect them to fight for me? Perhaps they think
I played Dicky false. They have reason&ndash;&ndash;he is not
here where he won his right to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then for the love of God, bring him here,&#8221; he
answered, forgetting himself. She started at that.</p>
<p>&#8220;No! No!&#8221; she cried hastily, as though fearing he
might make the attempt to find him; &#8220;not to save the
kingdom. You should listen to me to-night, General;
I am very wise. The reports which have come in are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
without exception bad. You arrest here, you arrest
there, but still the people gather and still they state
their wishes. I know how it is; at first they were
amused to have their queen,&ndash;&ndash;it was like a holiday.
Especially when Dicky talked to them. But freedom
is in the blood and it is as foolish to fight against it as
against the foreign ships we once tried to keep out of
our harbor. Carlina&ndash;&ndash;the old Carlina, your Carlina
and mine, is no more.&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused at the look of horror which had crept over
his withered face. She dropped her hand to his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I sound disloyal? It is only because the kingdom
remains as it used to be in your dear heart and
yours alone. I am your queen, General, because you
are still in the past. But the others are not. They
are of the present and to them I am only a tradition.
If they were all like you, my heart and soul, my life
and love would all be theirs. It is to save what is left
of the former things&ndash;&ndash;to save you and the few others
of that old kingdom&ndash;&ndash;to have our dear Carlina as we
used to have it out there in the sunshine of the garden&ndash;&ndash;that
I would leave this turmoil before it is too late.&#8221;</p>
<p>The white head drooped as she spoke,&ndash;&ndash;drooped
low over the wrinkled hands clasped upon the jeweled
sword handle. Dreams&ndash;&ndash;dreams that had seemed
about to come true in these his later years now faded
before his misty eyes. He had thought to see, before
he died, the glory of the former times returned; and
now his queen was the first to call them dead. For the
moment he felt himself as solitary as one returned from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
the grave. But, as she had said, if there were more like
Otaballo, the kingdom would still be, without all this
strife. <a name="P333A"></a>His stubborn thoughts refused to march into
the present. He raised his head again, still a general
of Carlina.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there is but one way in
which a servant of the house of Montferaldo may save
himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>And clicking his heels together, he had turned with
military precision and left her. Then she had tossed
the night long, dreaming horrible things. Now she
sat in her private apartments staring with troubled
eyes over the sunlit grounds. So an hour passed,
when without warning, the door snapped open,
closed, and she looked up, startled, to see Danbury
himself.</p>
<p>Her breath was cut off as though her heart had been
stopped, as when one thrusts in a finger and halts a
clock. There was the same dead silence that closes in
upon the cessation of the long-continued ticking&ndash;&ndash;a
silence as though the whole world paused a moment to
listen. He limped across the room to her side. She
saw that his hair was dishevelled, his coat torn, as
though he had been in a struggle. Then his arms closed
about her and she felt a great sense of safety, of relief,
as though everything had suddenly been settled for her.
There was no kingdom, no throne, no Otaballo, no cityful
of malcontents,&ndash;&ndash;nothing but Dicky. She felt as
much at peace as when they used to sit in the garden
together. All this other confusion had been only some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
story which he had told her. But in a minute he drew
back from her and thrust the present in again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;we must hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Dicky&ndash;&ndash;what is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The city is up in arms. We haven&#8217;t a second to
spare.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Otaballo&ndash;&ndash;my general?&#8221;</p>
<p>He clenched his fists at the memory.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead. They killed him and a handful of men at
his side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead&ndash;&ndash;my general dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like the brave general he was.&#8221;</p>
<p>She put her hands to her face. He drew her to his
shoulder where he let her weep a moment, his own
throat big.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but they shall answer for it!&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;Hush, dear. I&#8217;m coming back with a thousand men
and make &#8217;em sweat for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>His quick senses caught a sound without.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he commanded, &#8220;we shall be cut off here.&#8221;
He took her arm and hurried her along. They scurried
down the stairs and across the palace grounds to a small
gate in the rear. Here a carriage was waiting for them.
Danbury helped her in and stooped to kiss her lips before
he jumped up beside the driver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now drive for your life!&#8221; he commanded.</p>
<p>The whip fell across the quivering flanks of the nervous
animals and they leaped forward. The driver kept
to the deserted side streets where they raced along unchallenged,
but soon it became necessary to turn into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
the main thoroughfare in order to reach the water front
and the boat. In the four minutes it would require to
go those dozen blocks their fate would be decided. If
the army had not yet advanced that far, they would
be safe; otherwise he must depend upon a dash for it,
covering the mob with the two revolvers he had. Eight
shots to ward off the attack of a thousand men!</p>
<p>Danbury leaned far out over the box as the horses
took the turn at a speed which almost swung the rear
wheels clear of the ground. The animals had become
panic-stricken now and were bolting madly ahead like
horses from a burning stable.</p>
<p>But though the road looked clear they had not advanced
a block before men sprang up as though from
the ground. The populace had heard of the advancing
column and such as had not already joined it prepared
to meet it here. In order to avoid immediate suspicion,
they were forced to steady the horses down to
something like a walk. To Danbury it seemed as
though they had stopped stock-still. He was not a good
man in such a position as this; he was all for dashing
action. He could hardly sit still. They received many
side glances from the excited groups, but they passed
merely as a carriage full of nervous foreigners. Danbury
himself was not recognized. So they crept along
and Danbury gained hope, until they were within two
hundred yards of the turn which would take them out
of the line of march. Then with hoarse shouting, the
advance line of the revolutionists swept around a corner
and directly towards them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span></div>
<p>They were a yelling horde of half-drunken maniacs,&ndash;&ndash;a
disordered horde eager for the noisy excitement
their Southern blood craved. With half of them it was
more the frenzied love of flags and noise that had
brought them out than any deep-seated conviction of
right. But the thing that brought Danbury to attention
was the sight of Splinter with forty of his fellows
from the boat leading the crowd. In an instant he was
off the box and inside the carriage. He realized what
it would mean to be recognized by him. He had but one
thought&ndash;&ndash;to guard the safety of her within.</p>
<p>The driver advanced at a walk, keeping as close as
possible to the curbing. There was just one chance in
a thousand that the crowd might be too intent upon
their goal to bother with passing vehicles. They were
not after the Queen herself, for they looked upon her
as a mere girl influenced by Otaballo. Should they
chance upon her, undoubtedly they would feel obliged
to arrest her, but she was not at the moment of such
supreme importance as to make them alert to prevent
her escape. Danbury knew this. The danger lay in
the impudent curiosity of some one of the soldiers.
Each felt the license of the law breaker. It was the
spirit that led them to destroy property for the sheer
joy of destroying that he had to fear. He held his
weapon ready, sitting far back. The girl was white
and calm. They watched the first few stragglers pass
in dead silence; they heard the clattering confusion
yet to pass.</p>
<p>Then a soldier thrust his musket through the glass
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
with a coarse laugh. He peered within, but the girl&#8217;s
face was shielded so that the most he saw was that she
was a girl. The muzzle of Danbury&#8217;s revolver was
within a foot of his head and a finger trembled upon the
hair trigger. Still he forced himself to wait a second
longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out, my pretty lady&ndash;&ndash;get out an&#8217; join us,&#8221; he
shouted.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you there?&#8221; shouted his comrade.</p>
<p>Then someone started the cry:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Queen! It may be the Queen!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a rush towards the carriage. Danbury
fired through the bottom&ndash;&ndash;a signal to the driver to
dash for it. The horses sprang but were brought back
upon their haunches. Beatrice spoke to Danbury.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait. Not yet,&#8221; she pleaded as he raised his
weapon.</p>
<p>It was almost like Providence; a shout from across
the street which grew in volume until it drowned out
all other cries. Then a rush in that direction which
was followed blindly by every man of them. In a few
seconds the carriage was deserted. Danbury rose to
his feet and looked out. He almost lost his breath as
he saw Stubbs, Wilson, and a girl, the center of a thousand
excited men. The girl, white-cheeked, turned a
moment in his direction. He was dumbfounded. Then
he caught the cry, &#8220;Down with the traitors!&#8221;</p>
<p>The cry was taken up and voiced by a hundred
throats. He saw Stubbs thrust his fists in the faces
of the crowding men,&ndash;&ndash;saw him fight them back until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
his own blood boiled with the desire to stand by his
side. But the driver had whipped up the horses
again and the carriage was taking him away&ndash;&ndash;out
of danger to her. In spite of the look of quick relief
he saw in the face of Beatrice, he felt almost like
a deserter.</p>
<p>It was what Stubbs took to be a return of the bad
luck which had pursued him from childhood&ndash;&ndash;this
chance which led the three into the city at such a time
as this. They had thought of nothing when they rose
early that morning but of pushing through as soon as
possible to Bogova. Wilson felt that it was high time
that the girl reached civilization even as crude as it was
in that city, with some of its comforts. The hardships
were beginning to show in her thin cheeks and in dark
rings below her eyes. The outskirts of the city told
them nothing and so they trudged along with joyous
hearts intent only upon finding decent lodgings. They
had not even the warning of a shout for what was
awaiting them. The upper street had been empty and
they had turned sharply into this riot as though it
were a trap set to await them.</p>
<p>Both men were quick to understand the situation and
both realized that it meant danger. But Stubbs was
the first to shake himself free. He recognized the crew
at the head of the motley army. It roused his ire as
nothing else could. Instantly he felt himself again
their master. They were still only so many mutinous
sailors. He turned upon them with the same fierceness
which once had sent them cowering into the hold.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Ye yaller dogs,&#8221; he roared. &#8220;Get back! Get
back!&#8221;</p>
<p>They obeyed&ndash;&ndash;even though they stood at the head
of a thousand men, they obeyed. Once these fellows
admitted a man their master, he remained so for all
time. They shrank before his fists and dodged the
muzzle of his revolver as though they were once again
within the confines of a ship. In a minute he had
cleared a circle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; shouted Stubbs, &#8220;tell &#8217;em we&#8217;re through
with their two-cent revolution. Tell &#8217;em we&#8217;re &#8217;Mericans&ndash;&ndash;jus&#8217;
plain &#8217;Mericans. Tell &#8217;em thet and thet
I&#8217;ll put a bullet through the first man that lays a hand
on one of us. Splinter, ye blackguard,&ndash;&ndash;tell &#8217;em that!
Tell &#8217;em that!&#8221;</p>
<p>Through a Carlinian lieutenant who understood English,
Splinter made the leaders understand something
of what Stubbs had said. They demurred and growled
and shouted their protests. But Splinter added a few
words of his own and they became quieter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221; exploded Stubbs, impatiently; &#8220;perhaps
some of &#8217;em &#8217;members me. Tell &#8217;em we&#8217;re goin&#8217; home,
an&#8217; tell &#8217;em thet when a &#8217;Merican is bound fer home it
don&#8217;t pay fer ter try ter stop him. Tell &#8217;em we ain&#8217;t
goneter wait&ndash;&ndash;we&#8217;re goin&#8217; now.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned to Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; he commanded. Throwing up his arms
he pressed back the men before him as a policeman
brushes aside so many small boys. Whether it was
the sheer assurance of the man, whether it was his evident
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
control over their allies, or whether it was all over
before they had time to think, they retreated and
left a clear path for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You boys guard our rear,&#8221; he shouted back to
Splinter, &#8220;and when we&#8217;re outer sight ye can go ter
hell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obedient to the command, the small band of mercenaries
took their place behind the three retreating
figures. The latter made their way across the street
without hurrying and without sign of fear. They
turned a corner and so disappeared from sight. The
army paused a moment. Then someone raised a new
cry and it moved on, in three minutes forgetting the
episode.</p>
<p>Stubbs at the corner found himself in the arms of an
excited man, who, revolver in hand, had run back
to meet him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord!&#8221; exclaimed Danbury, &#8220;I was afraid I was
too late.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without further parley he hurried the girl into the
closed carriage and with a yell over his shoulder for
the two men to follow, clambered back upon the box.</p>
<p>&#8220;The boat&#8217;s at the dock,&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Steam all
up. Get on behind!&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men had their hands full to keep pace on foot
with those wild horses, but the distance was short. In
less than an hour the group was all on board the yacht
which had her nose pointed straight for the open sea.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3><i>The Open Door Closes</i></h3>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">It</span> was an excited but happy group of people who sat
down that night in the cozy cabin of the yacht after
a good day&#8217;s rest. Each of them had more than he
could tell, for no one would allow the other to omit any
details of these last adventurous weeks. Each had been
held in the clutch of a widely differing set of circumstances
and each had been forced to make something of
a lone fight of it. Here in the calm and luxury of this
cabin their lives, by the grace of God, had come to a
focus. First Danbury, as the host, was forced to begin
from the time he was lost at the gate to the palace.</p>
<p>He told of how he awoke in a certain house and
found himself under the care of the best nurse in the
world. But that didn&#8217;t last long, for the next thing
he knew he was on board his yacht and fifty miles out
at sea with a mutinous captain&ndash;&ndash;a captain who refused
to put back to port when ordered to do so at once. Instead
of that, the fellow ran him into a strange port,
took on board a surgeon (shanghaied him, in fact) and
refused to obey orders until three weeks later Danbury
was himself again plus a limp. Then he had come back
to Bogova only to be refused permission to anchor in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
harbor. He had come ashore one night in a dory, been
arrested and carried before Otaballo who refused to
recognize him and gave him the alternative of going to
jail or leaving the coast at once. It had all been an incomprehensible
mystery to him; the only explanation
he could think of being that the Queen was seized by
the General who had usurped the throne. He tried
once more to land and this time learned of the movement
afoot by the Republican party. He had made a
dash for the palace, forced his way through the guards,
and reached the Queen. Now he&#8217;d like an explanation
from her Majesty of the unfair advantage she had
taken of a wounded prisoner.</p>
<p>Her Majesty with an excited, happy laugh said that
if boys would get excited and act foolishly, the only
thing to do was to keep them out of trouble by force.
It was true that she had conspired to have him transported
and kept safe aboard his ship, because she knew
that if he came back, he would resent a great many
things she was forced to bear as a matter of diplomacy,
and would end by getting stabbed in the back. She
thought it was better to have a live lover, even though
he were a hundred miles away, than a dead soldier.
He scowled in disgust, but she reached his hand under
the table. She had given orders to Otaballo and then
she had lain awake all night crying because he had carried
them out. Her plan had been to get the kingdom
all straightened out and at peace, and then to abdicate.
But things had gone wrong and she told them a story
of plots and counterplots, of strange men arrested at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
her very door with knives in their hands, of a bomb
found in the palace, that held them breathless. Danbury
fairly boiled over with excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you had me tied up while those things were
going on? Trix&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll never forgive you. I might
have been a regular story-book hero.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in Carlina; you&#8217;d have been killed before
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rot! Don&#8217;t you think I&#8217;m old enough to take care
of myself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve come
with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have cleared up that trouble in a week,&#8221; he
exploded. &#8220;And as for those beggars of mine&ndash;&ndash;do
you know I risked my life to get their pay to them
through an agent? And then they turned against us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still for pay,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, their life will be a short one and a merry in
that crowd. Once the darned republic is running again,
they will be got rid of.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Danbury squirmed at having missed the excitement
at Bogova, he fairly writhed with envy of Stubbs
and Wilson. As he listened he hitched back and forth
in his chair, leaned over the table until he threatened
to sprawl among the glasses, and groaned jealously at
every crisis. Wilson told his story as simply as possible
from its beginning; the scenes at the house, his finding
the map, his adventures in Bogova, the long trip to the
cave, his danger there, and their dash back with the
treasure, omitting, however, the story of the Priest&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
relation to the girl as of too personal a nature. At this
point the black coffee was brought on, the steward dismissed,
and as a climax to the narrative the contents
of the twenty bags of jewels poured out upon the table.
They made a living, sparkling heap that held everyone
of them in silent wonder. Beneath the electric lights,
they took on their brightest hues, darting rays in all
directions, a dazzling collection which in value and
beauty was greater than any which has ever been gathered
at one time. To-day they are scattered all over the
world. There is not a collection in Europe which is
not the richer for one or more of them. They flash
upon the fingers of royalty, they sparkle upon the bosom
of our own richest, they are locked tight in the heavy
safes of London Jews, and at least four of them the
Rajah of Lamar ranks among the choicest of what is
called the most magnificent collection in the world. But
the two finest of them all, neither the money of Jews nor
the influence of royalty was powerful enough to secure;
one came as a wedding gift to Mrs. Danbury, and the
other was a gift from Stubbs to Jo.</p>
<p>For a few minutes they lay there together, as for so
long they had lain in the cave&ndash;&ndash;a coruscating fortune
of many millions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; gasped Danbury, &#8220;you fellows certainly
got all the fun and a good share of the profit out
of this trip. But&ndash;&ndash;did you say you left a pile
behind?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In gold. Twenty times what these are worth,&#8221; said
Wilson.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And you could locate it again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s buried under a mountain now, but you&#8217;re
welcome to the map if you wish to dig for it. I don&#8217;t
want any more of it. I found what I was
after.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at Jo who had become as silent as ever
the wife of Flores was. She had learned the same trick
of the eyes&ndash;&ndash;a sort of sheep-like content.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Stubbs,&#8221; broke out Danbury, &#8220;will <i>you</i> go
back with me? We&#8217;ll take dynamite and men enough
to blow out the whole mountain. Say, it will be bully
and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He felt warm fingers close over his own. It sent a
thrill the length of him, but also it told him that things
were different now&ndash;&ndash;that he must not plan for himself
alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he added slowly, &#8220;perhaps some day we can
go&ndash;&ndash;say ten years from now. Are you with me,
Stubbs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good enough to stow erway ter dream about,&#8221;
smiled Stubbs, catching a warning glance from Beatrice,
&#8220;but as fer me, I h&#8217;ain&#8217;t gut th&#8217; taste of rope
outer my mouth yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>They swept back the jewels into the bags and locked
them up in Danbury&#8217;s safe. The latter agreed to take
them to New York and see that they were properly
appraised so that a fair division could be made. Stubbs
protested that it wasn&#8217;t worth while.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jus&#8217; give me one bag of &#8217;em an&#8217; I guess thet will
last me out.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span></div>
<p>But Wilson insisted on the literal carrying out of
their bargain, share and share alike.</p>
<p>The remainder of the trip was a sort of extra honeymoon
for Danbury and Wilson, while Stubbs was content
to act as chaperone and bask in the reflected happiness
about him. The climax came with the double
wedding held on board the ship in Boston Harbor just
as soon as they could get a parson on board. The little
cabin was a bower of flowers and what the two girls
lacked in gowns (both Danbury and Wilson insisting
that to prepare a trousseau was a wholly unnecessary
waste of time) they made up in jewels. The dinner
which followed was worthy of the Astoria, <a name="P346"></a>for Togo,
the Japanese steward, was given carte blanche.</p>
<p>Stubbs was to go on to New York with Danbury, but
as to where he should go from there, he was mysterious.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a widder at Lisbon&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he hinted to
Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t find her, come back to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe so; maybe so. It&#8217;s God bless ye both, anyhow,
an&#8217; perhaps we&#8217;ll meet in the end at the Home
port.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>From the dark of their unlighted room in the hotel
Wilson and his wife stood side by side staring down
at the interminable procession of shuffling feet in
which, so short a time ago, they had been two units.
It had been just such a dusk time as this when she
had first got a glimpse of this man by her side. The
world had seemed very big and formidable to her then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
and yet she had felt something of the tingling romance
of it. Now as she gazed down through the misting
rain at the glazed streets and the shadows moving
through the paths of yellow lights from the windows,
she felt a yearning to be a part of them once more.</p>
<p>Once again she felt the gypsy call of things beyond;
<a name="P347"></a>once again she vibrated attune to the mystic song of the
dark. She felt stifled in here with her love. For the
moment she was even rebellious. After the sweep of
sky-piercing summits, after the unmeasured miles of
the sea, there was not room here for a heart so big as
hers. Somehow this room seemed to shut out the
sky. She wanted to go down into the crowd for a
little and brush shoulders with these restless people.
It would seem a little less as though she had been
imprisoned.</p>
<p>It seemed to her as though she would then be more
completely alone with him&ndash;&ndash;alone as they were those
first few hours when they had felt the press of the
world against them. For this night of nights, she
craved the isolation which had once been thrust
upon them. They were such guarded creatures here.
An hundred servants hedged them about,&ndash;&ndash;hedged
them in as zealously as jailers. The law&ndash;&ndash;that old
enemy&ndash;&ndash;patroled the streets now to keep them safe
where once it had thrust them out into the larger universe.
Outside still lay the broad avenues of dark
where one heard strange passings; where one was in
touch with the ungoverned. The rain sifted gently
from the uncharted regions above. It was there lovers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
should be&ndash;&ndash;there where one could swing the shoulders
and breathe deeply.</p>
<p>The girl snuggled uneasily closer to his side. The
two pressed to the window as though to get as far away
as possible from all the man-made furnishings about
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jo,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;we oughtn&#8217;t to be shut in.&#8221;</p>
<p>She found his hand and grasped it with the strength
of one who thrills with the deeper understanding. She
trembled in the grip of that love which, at least once in
a woman&#8217;s life, lifts her to a higher plane than can be
reached outside a madhouse. She felt a majestic scorn
of circumstance. She was one with Nature herself,&ndash;&ndash;she
and her man. She laid her hot cheek against his
heart. She had not yet been kissed, withdrawing from
his lips half afraid of the dizzy heights to which they
beckoned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get back into the dark, Jo,&#8221; he whispered
again, drawing her towards him; &#8220;back where I found
you, Jo. I want to get outside once more&ndash;&ndash;with you.
I want to be all alone with you once more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;David! David!&#8221; she cried joyously, &#8220;I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to start life with you from here. I
want to start from where we stood before the fire all
wet. It was there I found you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! Yes!&#8221; she answered, scarcely able to get her
breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was meant for us to begin there. We were
turned aside for a little into strange paths, but we&#8217;ll
go back now. Shall we?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she panted. &#8220;Let us start now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>They hurried out of the room and down the broad
marble stairs to the hotel foyer as though fearing something
was behind them to seize and hold them prisoner.
The smug, well-dressed men and women who were
lounging there staring listlessly at the rain, glanced up
with a quicker interest in life at sight of their flushed
cheeks and eager eyes. They caught in them the living
fire which in their own breasts was ash-covered by the
years.</p>
<p>The man at the swinging doors straightened at their
approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I get you an umbrella, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Wilson, with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is raining hard, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is raining, thank God.&#8221;</p>
<p>They moved out upon the steps and the carriage
porter put his whistle to his lips. Wilson shook his
head and gripped the arm of the excited girl by his
side.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, sir&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; gasped the porter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you don&#8217;t belong to the night,&#8221; said
Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord!&#8221; muttered the porter as he saw them step
into the wet. &#8220;Lord! they&#8217;re mad&ndash;&ndash;mad as hatters.&#8221;</p>
<p>They swung into the damp stream of men and women
with a fresh influx of strength. They felt the action of
the world&ndash;&ndash;the vibrating pulse of the engines. The
Law still stood on the outside like an umpire, but there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
were still many forces at work which the Law could
not detect, many opportunities for Chance to work, for
the quick hand to move stealthily. It was something
of this they felt, as they brushed along.</p>
<p>But they wished freer play even than this,&ndash;&ndash;they
wished to get where the Law alone stood between them
and their ego&ndash;&ndash;and then once more face down the Law.
They turned into the big, dripping park with its primeval
furnishings of earth and grass and trees and deep
shadows. It was amid such surroundings alone that
their own big, fundamental emotions found adequate
breathing space. They plunged into the silent by-paths
as a sun-baked man dives to the sandy bottom of a crystal
lake. And into it all they blended as one&ndash;&ndash;each
feeling the glory of a perfected whole. Each saw with
his own eyes and the eyes of the other, too. It was as
though each were given five new senses.</p>
<p>Near one of the large trees a shadow detached itself
and stepped towards them. It was a man in a
rubber coat and a helmet.</p>
<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; she whispered to him, &#8220;it is one of them!&#8221;</p>
<p>He saw and the old fighting instinct returned&ndash;&ndash;the
old rebellion. But with it came a new responsibility.
It was no longer just himself against this thing&ndash;&ndash;no
longer the same wild freedom that took no account of
consequences.</p>
<p><a name="P350"></a>&#8220;See,&#8221; she trembled. &#8220;Shall we run?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she clutched his arm more tightly. There was
no need of running now. He was there to face things&ndash;&ndash;to
stand firm and batter off.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, David!&#8221; she broke out, &#8220;we&ndash;&ndash;we can&#8217;t run
any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered steadily, &#8220;we must go straight
ahead and pass him.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they did, and as the policeman stooped a little
the better to see their faces, they each lifted their
eyes to him and laughed. He tipped his helmet.</p>
<p>&#8220;A bad night, sir,&#8221; he said genially.</p>
<p>&#8220;A bully night,&#8221; answered Wilson.</p>
<p>They went on more slowly after this, across the
park and toward the broad avenue. They came to
where the brownstone houses blinked their yellow eyes
at them. The boards were all down now and the street
all a-twinkle with fairy lights.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember how they did that before?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;And how warm it looked inside? David&ndash;&ndash;David&ndash;&ndash;they
can&#8217;t make me feel lonesome any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but we can&#8217;t laugh at them; we must laugh
with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>She made up a little face at a big French window
which seemed to stare insolently at them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need you any more,&#8221; she said to it.</p>
<p>They came to the only house on the street which was
still boarded against the heat of the summer. Here
they paused. She seized his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is it,&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;That is where we
began!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but&ndash;&ndash;it looks different, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It has grown older&ndash;&ndash;more sober.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Shall we go in?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up and down the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;If only we could get chased&ndash;&ndash;<i>once</i> more!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can pretend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And go in the back way as we did before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is good. Come.&#8221;</p>
<p>She placed her hand within his and they turned
down the alley which led to the back street facing the
water front. The lights still blinked in the mist&ndash;&ndash;the
waves still pounded against the stone walls throwing
up salt spray, but they no longer came from out an
unfathomable distance. They seemed like very petty
waves and the two knew the boundaries, before and
back of them, as they had not before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she said, &#8220;run&ndash;&ndash;run for all you&#8217;re
worth!&#8221;</p>
<p>She led the pace, he falling back to keep with her
instead of dragging her on. So they ran until they were
breathless. Then as before they moved a-tiptoe.</p>
<p>They knew the little door when they reached it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must break it in again,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>So she stood back while he threw his weight against
it, meeting it with his shoulders. She watched him
with a thrill&ndash;&ndash;her heart leaping with every thud of
his body against the wood. It was her man forcing a
path for her,&ndash;&ndash;her man beating down a barrier. She
felt the sting of the wind-driven spray against her
cheek, but the depths from which it came no longer
called to her. Rather they drove her in. She was content
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
to be here with her man. Life opened big to her
from just where she stood.</p>
<p>The door gave finally, as she knew it must, and hand
in hand they entered the paved yard. He fastened the
door behind them and yet as he put the joist in place,
it was not as it was before. There was no one in pursuit
now. She found herself, however, as anxious to see his
face and learn what this meant to him as she had been
the first time. For after all, even if it were different,
it was just as new and unpathed a world they were entering
as the other. She took his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stoop nearer to me, David.&#8221;</p>
<p>She saw that his lips were less tense, that there was
less of a strain to his shoulders, but that his eyes burned
no less brightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>He went in through the window and opened the door
for her. The house smelled just as musty as before,
but there was less thrill to the dark. They lighted a
bit of candle and made their way along the lower hall,
up the broad stairs and so into the very room where
they had stood a few months before. There were no
strange creakings now, no half-guessed movements
among the curtains, no swift-gliding shadows more felt
than seen. There were no such vast spaces above, and
no uncertain alleys of dark. They were among the
known things, the certain, the sure.</p>
<p>He found kindling and lighted the fire. It flared
up briskly and threw flickering rays into the big room.
The two pressed close to it, for their clothes were wet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span>
Not a thing was altered in the room and yet it was a
different room. The room was now a part of this house,
the house was part of the street, the street was part of
the city, the city part of the man-made world. For a
moment the walls pressed in upon them as the hotel
walls had done, and the ceilings shut out the stars.
Then he turned and met her eyes. They were clear
now&ndash;&ndash;unshadowed by doubt, fear, or question. He
knew what it meant,&ndash;&ndash;at length she was altogether
out of the web. It was odd but he had never kissed
her lips. He had waited for this.</p>
<p>She looked up at him and as she looked, she seemed
to sink deeper than ever into the golden, misty region
which lay below the outer dark of his eyes. She felt
a tingling warmth suffuse her whole body; she felt
the room about her quicken to new life; and above
her head she knew the stars were shining again. She
came into his arms putting her hands upon his shoulder,
throwing back her head with half-closed eyes.
He stooped, his lips brushed her lips; then met firmly
in a clinging kiss which set the world about them
into a mad riot.</p>
